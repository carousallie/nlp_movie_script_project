There is no rain. \\n\\nA figure lies against a tree, eyes closed - this is \\nSCHOFIELD, early-20s. Soft features.\\n\\nA man is sleeping next to him on the grass - BLAKE, 19, \\nyouthful, strapping. \\n\\nSERGEANT SANDERS (O.S.)\\n\\nBlake doesn’t stir. \\n\\nBlake. \\n\\nBlake!\\n\\nSERGEANT SANDERS (O.S.)

Blake holds out his hand to \\nSchofield. Schofield opens his eyes - they are gentle, wise. \\nSchofield grudgingly raises his hand for a lift.\\n\\nBlake heaves him to his feet - his uniform is identical to \\nBlake’s, same rank, the only difference is the brass wound \\nstripe on Schofield’s left sleeve. \\n\\nThey trudge towards Sanders, fastening their webbing. A \\nsmattering of SOLDIERS - same regiment - same state of \\nfatigue and filth, lie around them.

I \\nthought we might get some decent \\ngrub out here - only reason I \\ndecided against the priesthood. \\n\\nSchofield lets out a laugh. Blake looks on hungrily as they \\npass by the mess tents.\\n\\nSchofield rummages in his pockets, finds what he’s looking \\nfor - a handkerchief with some food wrapped in it.

This time next week it’ll \\nbe chicken dinner.\\n\\nThe trench drops deeper into the earth... \\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nNot me.

The world above has now disappeared.\\n\\nSCHOFIELD\\n\\nIt’s easier not to go back at all. \\n\\nBlake registers this - looks at him. \\n\\nThe wider Rear Trench crosses their path.

THREE ROYAL ENGINEERS are \\nworking on them, tagging and testing. They duck around them.   \\n\\nSanders turns a corner, and comes to a stop. Just beyond him \\nis the dark, yawning mouth of a Dugout. \\n\\nSERGEANT SANDERS (CONT'D)\\nNow listen, Erinmore is inside, so \\ntidy yourselves up. \\n\\nThey are suddenly alert.\\n\\nSERGEANT SANDERS (CONT'D)\\nYou never know - might be mentions \\nin dispatches for this one, if you \\ndon’t bugger it up. \\n\\n(CONTINUED)\\n(CONTINUED)\\n\\n\\x0c                                                                6.\\n                                                                6.\\n\\nCONTINUED: (2)\\nCONTINUED: (2)\\n\\nSanders gives them a look, and disappears inside the dugout. \\n\\nSchofield quickly buttons up his tunic, hiding any sins there \\nmay be underneath. \\n\\nBlake nervously tidies himself, leans in to Schofield.\\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nMust be something big if the \\nGeneral’s here.\\n\\nThey enter.\\n\\nINT. DUGOUT - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nLit by paraffin lamps, it takes Schofield a moment for his \\neyes to adjust to the half-light. He and Blake hand their \\nrifles to the ORDERLIES, salute, and stand at attention.    \\n\\nThere is a simmering sense of unease in this place. \\n\\nIn the centre of the room, there are two tables. On one table \\nlie several maps, on the other are a number of large aerial \\nreconnaissance photographs. \\n\\nGENERAL ERINMORE (50s), LIEUTENANT GORDON (40s) and a CAPTAIN \\nare gathered around the far table, looking down at the \\naerials, talking in hushed tones.   \\n\\nOther men watch from the shadows - TWO NCOs and ANOTHER \\nORDERLY.\\n\\nGeneral Erinmore turns around. Looks at Blake and Schofield.\\n\\nSERGEANT SANDERS\\nLance Corporals Blake and \\nSchofield, Sir. \\n\\nGENERAL ERINMORE\\nWhich one of you is Blake? \\n\\nSir. \\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nERINMORE\\n\\nYou have a brother, a Lieutenant in \\nthe 2nd Devons?  \\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nYes, sir.

That true?\\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nGood enough, Sir. \\n\\nERINMORE\\n\\nSo.\\n\\nErinmore turns the map to face Blake. The British lines are \\nmarked in blue, the German lines in red.\\n\\nHe points out a cross on the map at Croisilles Wood. \\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\n\\nWe are here. The 2nd Devons are \\nadvancing here.\\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\n\\nHow long will it take you to get \\nthere?\\n\\nBlake hesitantly studies it. Croisilles Wood sits in the \\ncentre of a huge area of land, which is scored as occupied \\nterritory. \\n\\nBLAKE\\nI don’t understand, Sir.\\n\\nSCHOFIELD\\nSir, that land is held by the \\nGermans.\\n\\nERINMORE\\nGermans have gone. \\n\\nShock plays on their faces.  \\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\nDon’t get your hopes up.

He sent word yesterday \\nmorning that he was going after the \\nretreating Germans. He is convinced \\nhe has them on the run - that if he \\ncan break their lines now, he will \\nturn the tide. He is wrong. \\n\\nSchofield watches Blake as he begins to register what this \\nmight mean. \\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\n\\nColonel Mackenzie has not seen \\nthese aerials of the enemy’s new \\nline.\\n\\nErinmore turns to the other table. \\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\nCome round here, Gentlemen. \\n\\nBlake and Schofield move to the next table.

Field \\nfortifications, defences and \\nartillery the like of which we’ve \\nnever seen before.\\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\n\\nThe 2nd are due to attack the line \\nshortly after dawn tomorrow.

We see the \\ndistinctive red stamp of Army Command. \\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\n\\nDeliver this to Colonel Mackenzie. \\nIt is a direct order to call off \\ntomorrow morning’s attack. \\n\\nErinmore speaks slowly, desperate to impress upon Blake and \\nSchofield the gravity of this situation. Nothing can be \\nmisunderstood.\\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\nIf you don’t, it will be a \\nmassacre. We would lose two \\nbattalions. Sixteen hundred men, \\nyour brother among them.\\n\\nSchofield hides his shock. But Blake looks at Erinmore, \\ndetermination etched in his face: understood.\\n\\nERINMORE (CONT'D)\\n\\nDo you think you can get there in \\ntime?\\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nYes, Sir.\\n\\nERINMORE\\n\\nAny questions?\\n\\nBLAKE\\n\\nNo, Sir. \\n\\nSchofield eyes flick to Blake: No questions?

The land stretches out ahead of him in \\nthe early light. \\n\\nHe listens to the wind in the leaves. Birdsong.\\n\\nHe undoes his breast pocket. He pulls out the small tobacco \\ntin.
