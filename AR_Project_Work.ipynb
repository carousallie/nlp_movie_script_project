Brahms, Franz \\nLiszt, Chopin--it’s all I ever \\nwanted to play. \\n(smile fades)\\n\\nBut I was persuaded by my record \\ncompany to pursue a career in \\npopular music instead. They told me \\naudiences would never accept a \\nblack pianist on the classical \\nstage. Wanted to turn me into just \\nanother “colored entertainer.” You \\nknow, the guy who smokes while he’s \\nplaying, who puts a glass of whisky \\non the piano and then gets mad when \\nhe’s not respected like Arthur \\nRubinstein.

They have jobs. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nImmaculate Heart is already a \\nluxury. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nImmaculate FART. You wanted that, \\nnot me! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMiguel saw someone knifed in front \\nof him at Sac High, is that what \\nyou want? You’re telling me that \\nyou want to see someone knifed \\nright in front of you? \\n\\nTHEY BAG AT THE GROCERY STORE. \\nThat is not a career and they went \\nto BERKELEY.MARION \\n\\nYour father’s company is laying people off right and left, did \\nyou know that? No of course not because you don’t care about \\nanyone but yourself. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n4. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHe barely saw that. I want to go \\nwhere culture is, like New York. \\n\\nMARION \\nHow in the world did I raise \\nsuch a SNOB? \\n\\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOr at least Connecticut or \\nNew Hampshire. Where writers \\nlive in the woods. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou couldn’t get into those schools \\nanyway. \\n\\nMOM! \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou can’t even pass your driver’s \\ntest. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBecause you wouldn’t let me \\npractice enough! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nThe way you work, the way you don’t \\nwork, you’re not even worth state \\ntuition, Christine. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCALL ME LADY BIRD LIKE YOU SAID YOU \\nWOULD! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou should just go to City College, \\nwith your work ethic. City College \\nand then to jail then back to City \\nCollege. Maybe you’d learn how to \\npull yourself up and not expect \\neveryone to do everything for \\nyou... \\n\\nMY NAME IS LADY BIRD! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION (CONT\\'D) \\n\\nWell actually, it’s not, and \\nit’s ridiculous. Your name \\nis Christine. \\n\\nThey slow for a stop light and Lady Bird dramatically opens \\nthe door and rolls out of the car. Marion screams. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5. \\n\\nINT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY. \\n\\nClose on a cast. In very small letters is written “fuck you, \\nmom.” The cast belongs to Lady Bird. She follows along with \\nthe mass. \\n\\nCREDITS run over this joint liturgy between Immaculate Heart \\nof Mary (girls school) and Xavier (boys school) and beginning \\nof the year activities. \\n\\nA sea of catholic girls’ school uniforms in bleachers during \\ncandidate speeches. \\n\\nCANDIDATE \\n(finishing her speech) \\nA Vote for Amanda is a vote for \\nboys. Boys and healthy vending \\nmachines because no one wants a \\nmuffin with that many calories. \\n\\nLady Bird waits her turn to make her speech, and makes eye \\ncontact with Julie in the crowd, a sweet, chubby 17 year old. \\nHer best friend. \\n\\n \\n5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 “beginning of senior year” \\nspeeches from the teachers. A few teachers are nuns. \\n\\nBack in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of \\nJesus. The priest gives his homily. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\nThere are the classics: St. \\nAugustine, of course, and Aquinas. \\nMy favorite, Kierkegaard - wait \\nuntil you hear his love story - it \\nwill make you swoon. \\n\\nPRIEST \\n\\nWe’re afraid we won’t get into the \\ncollege of our choice, we’re afraid \\nwe won’t be loved, we won’t be \\nliked, we won’t succeed. \\n\\nEveryone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses \\nher arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion, \\nshe’s not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion. \\nIt’s somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN (V.O.) \\nSome of the students were disturbed \\nby your posters. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. VICE-PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOAN’S OFFICE. DAY. \\n\\nSister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of \\nLady Bird’s campaign materials. \\n\\n6. \\n\\nReveal of the poster: Lady Bird’s head on a bird body. \\nAnother shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIt’s just a bird head on a lady \\nbody or vice versa. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nI think it’s a little upsetting... \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nIt’s my tradition to run for \\noffice. Don’t worry, I won’t win. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nThat’s not what I’m worried about. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(worried) \\n\\nThis won’t mess with my \\nscholarship, will it? \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nNo, you’re okay there. \\n\\n(trying to be helpful) \\n\\nYou have a performative streak, I \\nthink. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI think that too. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nMaybe you’d enjoy theatre arts... \\nThey are having auditions for the \\nfall musical. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDo we have that here? \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nIt’s a collaborative effort with \\nthe men at Xavier. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHow am I a senior and not know we \\nhave that? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nPerhaps you haven’t always been an \\nactive part of this community. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nThey do a fall musical and a spring \\nplay and from what I hear it’s a \\nreal blast. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhat I’d really like is to be on \\nMath Olympiad. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\n(gently) \\n\\nBut math isn’t something that you \\nare terribly strong in? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThat we know of YET. \\n\\nCLOSE ON A LIST. \\n\\nSign ups for auditions for the fall musical. A hand reaches \\nup and takes the pen attached and writes, in all caps: \\n\\nCHRISTINE “LADY BIRD” McPHERSON \\n\\nAnd then another hand reaches up and writes: \\n\\nJULIANNE “JULIE” PICKETT \\n\\nReveal Julie and Lady Bird debating this: \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) \\n\\n“Julie” doesn’t need to be in \\nquotes. \\n\\nJULIE (O.S.) \\n\\nBut it’s not my real name. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIt’s not the same thing. \\n\\nJULIE \\n(shaking her head) \\n\\nI’m not sure you’re right... \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8. \\n\\nEXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. LATE AFTERNOON. \\n\\nJulie and Lady Bird walk through the “fancy” neighborhood, \\n“The Fabulous Forties.” They stop in front of this very \\nspecific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories \\nand blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It \\nlooks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house. \\n\\nJULIE \\nI love this neighborhood. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYeah, it’s so beautiful. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nIf I lived here I would definitely \\nhave my wedding in the backyard. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI’d have friends over all the time \\nto study and eat snacks. I’d be \\nlike “MOM WE’RE TAKING THE SNACKS \\nUPSTAIRS TO THE TV ROOM.” \\n\\nJULIE \\nI’d have my own bathroom. \\n\\nCHECKER \\n\\nI can’t stop you dicks from hanging \\nout here but quit wrinkling all the \\nmagazines! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWhen I’m in this store, I’m not \\nyour sister - I’m a customer, \\nMiguel! I’m always right! \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nEver since she moved in, your \\nbrother and Shelly are becoming \\nthe same person. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo way. \\n\\nINT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING. \\n\\nJulie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout \\naisle. A Checker calls out to them: \\n\\nThis is Miguel. Lady Bird’s brother. 22, Latino, clearly \\nadopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan, \\n22, a Bagger: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nShelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and \\n“interesting” piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like \\nthey’re wearing black leather jackets even when they aren’t. \\n\\n9. \\n\\nThe girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in \\nfront of the New York City skyline. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nYeah, okay, maybe. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(re: magazine) \\n\\nSee, why I don’t look like that? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nJust once I’d like to have the \\nsong “New York Groove” play and \\nfeel like it really applies to \\nmy life. \\n\\nYou’ve never even been to New York. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThat’s why I’m applying to New York \\ncolleges - do you know if Sarah \\nLawrence is actually IN the city? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYour parents would pay for that? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nScholarships, financial aid. I’ll \\nfigure it out. My Mom thinks I \\ncan’t get in but she is sorely \\nmistaken. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWhat about terrorism? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDon’t be a Republican. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI’m probably just going to go to \\nCity College. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n(almost yelling)  \\n\\nPUT THE MAGAZINE BACK.SHIT. \\n\\nINT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nMarion yawns. Luis, a large Filipino man, approaches her: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n10. \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nYou doing okay, mama? \\n\\nMARION \\nYes, but that was terrifying \\nwasn’t it? Thank god you were \\nthere. I guess I can’t have \\npencils anymore.  \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nYeah, gotta go back to just felt \\ntip markers. Crayola. \\n\\nMarion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a \\nsmall bag: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOh Luis this is for you! I got it \\nfor the baby, I couldn’t resist it.  \\n\\nHe pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler. \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nShe loves pink! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell, it’s really more for you and \\nAndrea than it is for the baby, and \\nI’m sorry I didn’t have time to \\nwrap it.... \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nNo, it’s perfect. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nSee you tomorrow... I mean, later? \\n\\nLuis just laughs. \\n\\nINT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nMarion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves \\nthese streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When she’s \\nnot resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an \\nenormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with \\nMarion. \\n\\nEXT. LADY BIRD’S NEIGHBORHOOD. EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nMarion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the \\npaper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly \\nmiddle class. Marion waves to neighbors. They wave back. She \\npicks up the mail, bills, papers, etc. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. BATHROOM. MORNING. \\n\\nDad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on \\nthe edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail, \\ngoing through it. \\n\\n11. \\n\\nLARRY \\nDid you know toothpaste is \\nbasically ineffective? It’s like \\nsucking on a mint. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(to Larry, shaking her \\n\\nhead) \\n\\nMike Kerry died. I didn’t know he \\nwas sick again. \\n\\nLARRY \\nHow old was he? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOnly fifty-six. \\n\\nKnocking at the door. \\n\\nMIGUEL (O.S.) \\n\\nCan Shelly and I get in there? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIn a minute honey Dad and I are \\nstill in here! \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\n(re: Mike) \\nThat’s too young. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(calling) \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI AM DRESSED. \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD YOU BETTER BE DRESSED! \\n \\n\\nMARION (CONT’D) \\n\\nI’ll send them a note. \\n\\n(a little softer) \\n\\nDo you think that Shelly and Miguel \\nhave sex on the pullout couch? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nOh yeah. \\n\\nMarion laughs at Larry’s subtle joke. He laughs at her \\nlaughter. They like each other. \\n\\nINT. KITCHEN. MORNING. \\n\\nMiguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion \\nmakes Lady Bird’s breakfast and her lunch. \\n\\nWhy can’t I just make the eggs? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nBecause you take too long and make \\na big mess and then I have to clean \\nit up. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\n(small voice) \\n\\nEggs aren’t good for the \\nenvironment, anyway. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(too loud) \\n\\nWHAT? \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nYou heard her. \\n\\nMARION \\n(placing the eggs) \\nHere, eat quickly, PLEASE. \\n\\nLARRY \\n(re: paper) \\n\\nLook at all these pictures. Every \\nnewspaper looks like USA Today. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nShelly and I are trying to be \\nvegan. Hence the soy milk. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou wear leather jackets. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nThey’re vintage. It doesn’t support \\nthe industry. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(poking at the eggs) \\n\\nThey aren’t done, there’s white \\nstuff. \\n \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nYou know how you love Brambles? \\nPigs are smarter than him even. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI never thought Brambles was a \\nGENIUS okay? \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\n(very obnoxious) \\n\\nMOM! The eggs are NOT DONE! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nFINE MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING EGGS. \\n\\nMarion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and \\nretreats to the bathroom. The noisy hair-dryer starts up. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI WANTED TO YOU WON’T LET ME! \\n\\nLady Bird follows Marion out of the room. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nYour sister doesn’t like me. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.)  \\n\\nMOM!!! I’M HUNGRY! \\n \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nShe does. \\n\\nShelly gets up, pouting. MIGUEL follows her \\n\\n \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\n\\nYOU HAD YOUR CHANCE! \\nGOING TO BED! \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLarry is left alone. It’s weirdly peaceful for half a second. \\n\\nINT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly \\nchanges the radio station, finds a song she likes: \\n\\n14. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDid you know that Alanis Morisette \\nwrote this song in only ten \\nminutes? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nI believe it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(she smiles) \\n\\nSo I’m applying to a couple East \\nCoast schools. I need you to help \\nme with the financial aid \\napplication but Mom can’t know. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nWe... aren’t they quite \\nexpensive? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nFirst, yes that’s why financial \\naid. Second, I have to get in \\nfirst. \\n\\nMom won’t be happy about it. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhich is why I don’t want to fight \\nabout it before I have to. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school. \\n\\n15. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nJust pull over here \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nAre you sure, I can drive you to \\nthe front -- \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, just this is fine. I like to \\nwalk. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nOkay, well, I love you. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nSo what do you think? About \\ncollege? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nI’ll see what I can do. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(kisses him on the cheek) \\nThanks Dad, love you too. Have a \\ngood day at work. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nHey, I’m like Keith Richards “I’m \\njust happy to be anywhere.” \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(calling out) \\n\\nHey bitch! \\n\\nShe gets out quickly and hurries away. She’s almost at school \\nwhen Julie pulls up. \\n\\nMs. Pickett has VERY LARGE fake breasts. Her boyfriend, Matt, \\nhands a sack lunch to Lady Bird and Julie. \\n\\nMATT \\n\\nAlright girls, hope you like \\npickles. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own \\nlunch into a garbage can. The one her Mom spent time making. \\n\\n16. \\n\\nMs. Pickett gets in the driver’s seat, they drive away. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nThanks, Uncle Matt. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nSweet! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHe’s not your uncle. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nIt’s something I’m trying out. \\nBye, mom. \\n \\n (watching Ms. Pickett go) \\n\\nYour Mom really likes you. \\n\\nJULIE \\nYeah. I just keep getting \\nfatter.  \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\n(mouth full) \\n\\nMe too. Matt is awesome. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYeah, I hope he marries my Mom. \\nThat would be nice. He promised me \\nhis old car when I turn eighteen. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThat car should be illegal. Jenna \\nWalton’s not doing any off-roading. \\nShe just goes to Pavillions. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI heard Jenna Walton has a tanning \\nbed in her house. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nShe is so pretty. \\n \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nHer skin is luminous.  \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nMaybe we should try tanning. \\n\\nIn the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy \\nRange Rover. She’s pretty in a high school way. \\n\\nThe girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls \\ndescend on her. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n17. \\n\\nINT. VESTMENT ROOM. DAY \\n\\nLady Bird and Julie sit with their legs up the wall, eating \\ncommunion wafers out of a large plastic container. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nYeah, in the tub I just scoot \\nmyself under like now, like this, \\nand then the water just... \\n\\nShe gestures, showing that the water would flow into her \\ncrotch and get her off. They are hysterically laughing. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWe are so gross! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI think I figured it out when I was \\nlike three or something. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI use, I take off the shower head, \\noh god this is so embarrassing! I \\nuse that. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI don’t know if mine is the right \\nkind, though. Maybe it’s different \\nwhen you actually have a penis in \\nthere, like it’s more intense. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nMine is pretty intense, I think. \\n\\nDARLENE \\n\\nYou’re not supposed to eat the \\nwafers! \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(trying to be helpful) \\n\\nThey aren’t consecrated. \\n\\nDarlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in. \\n\\nDarlene turns on her heel, annoyed. Lady Bird and Julie \\ndissolve into giggles. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird, wearing an extreme “audition” dress, and Julie, in \\nher uniform, sit and watch other students perform. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n18. \\n\\nFather Leviatch runs auditions - there is something funny and \\ndepressed about him. An overweight woman, Miss Patty, \\naccompanies on the piano when needed. \\n\\nA boy, Greg, is up. He has a big voice for such a tiny boy: \\n\\nGREG \\n\\n“BEING ALIVVEEEEEEEEEE......!” \\n\\nCut to Father Leviatch calling out from his clipboard: \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nOkay, Christine? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nLady Bird. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\nIs that your given name? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYes. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nWhy is it in quotes? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWell I gave it to myself. It’s \\ngiven. To me, by me. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nOK, take it away, Lady Bird. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n“Everybody says don’t / Everybody \\nsays don’t / Everybody says don’t \\nit isn’t right, don’t it isn’t \\nniiiiiceeee / Everybody says don’t \\n/ Everybody says don’t / Everybody \\nsays don’t walk on the grass....” \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(singing) \\n\\n“Make me a channel of your peace / \\nwhere there’s despair in life let \\nme bring hope / where there is \\ndarkness only light / and where \\nthere’s sadness ever joy....” \\n\\nCut to Lady Bird singing her song. \\n\\nCut to Julie, wearing her uniform, shy and nervous: \\n\\nJulie has a sweet, clear, beautiful voice. It’s a quiet \\nmoment and everyone pays attention. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMore girls and more boys. Now most everyone is done. \\n\\nDanny stands. He’s very handsome. Strapping, even. He gives \\nhis sheet music to the Miss Patty. Then he sings: \\n\\n19. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\n(singing) \\n\\n“There are giants in the sky! / \\nThere are big tall terrible giants \\nin the sky! When you’re way up \\nhigh and you look below at the \\nworld you’ve left and the things \\nyou know little than a glance is \\nenough to show you just how small \\nyou are!” \\n\\nHe’s AMAZING. Julie and Lady Bird look at each other. DREAM \\nBOAT CITY. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nUnderneath her window sill by her bed, Lady Bird writes the \\nname: \\n\\nDANNY. \\n\\nShe’s in love and want to make it permanent somewhere. \\nSuddenly, a voice is directed right at Lady Bird’s door: \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\nI CAN SEE THE LIGHT ON IN YOUR ROOM \\nGO TO BED! \\n\\nLady Bird shuts off her light and sleeps, dreaming of Danny. \\n\\nEXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY \\n\\nLady Bird and Julie check the casting list. They first find: \\n\\nMERRILY WE ROLL ALONG \\n\\nFranklin Shepard: Danny O’Neill, Charlie Kringus: Greg Anrue \\n\\nGussie: Diana Greenway, Beth: Julie Steffans. \\n\\nThey move way down the list until they find: \\n\\nSwing/Chorus: Christine McPherson \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(tightly) \\nCongratulations. \\n\\nJULIE \\nYou too! We both got in! \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n20. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nEveryone who auditioned got in. The \\npart I got was basically not \\ngetting in. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(trying to downplay) \\n\\nI do not even know how I got cast \\nin my part. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMe neither. I was the one who had a \\ndress and prepared a song. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI know! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(thinking) \\n\\nNow you’re going to get romantic \\nwith Danny on stage. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nIt’s probably my only shot at that, \\nyou know? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMom... \\n\\nMARION \\n(re: the magazine) \\nWe don’t need to buy that. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIt’s only three dollars. I’m having \\na hard week. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIf you want to read it we can go to \\nthe public library. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI want to read it in bed. \\n\\n \\nShe take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes LADY \\nBIRD. Leaves. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nJulie stays and when she’s sure she’s alone she touches her \\nname - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen. \\n\\nINT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING. \\n\\nMarion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a BRIDE magazine. \\n\\n\\x0cMARION \\n\\nThat’s something rich people do. \\nWe are not rich people. \\n\\n21. \\n\\nLady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath \\nher sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it. \\n\\nAs she’s performing this maneuver, she sees DANNY (!) and his \\nMom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nHey! \\n\\nHi. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCome here often? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\n(not getting the joke) \\n\\nExcuse me? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(extending her hand) \\n\\nI’m Lady Bird, we’re going to be in \\nthe musical together. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nOh, yeah, I remember you! You were \\nwearing that dress. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI just wanted to say what’s up and \\nI’ll see you in rehearsal. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThanks, I’m super excited. You live \\nin the neighborhood? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(doing a voice) \\n\\nNah, I’m from the wrong side of the \\ntracks. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nWhat? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIs  that  your  family?  There  are  so \\nmany of you! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nIrish-Catholic! It’s hard to find a \\ngirl to date that’s not my cousin. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n22. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(flustered) \\n\\nWell, okay. You’re going to make a \\ngreat Franklin. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThanks! I want my hair, his hair \\nto be curly, though. \\n\\nYeah! \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLike Jim Morrison. Very ’70s. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nLike Jim Morrison exactly. \\n\\nDANNY! \\n\\nDANNY’S MOM \\n \\n\\nGotta go! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWho is Jim Morrison again? \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nHe was in a rock band, moron, The \\nDoors. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI knew that. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(looking at the bill) \\n\\nThis is with your employee \\ndiscount? \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nYeah, it’s already included. \\n\\nLady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he \\nscans their groceries and Shelly bags them. \\n\\nMarion looks worried. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON. \\n\\nEveryone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty \\nteaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She \\ncan move amazingly well for a bigger woman. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThey play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father \\nLeviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making \\neveryone feel included. \\n\\nThe priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where \\neveryone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing. \\n\\n23. \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nTo get our emotions going, we’re \\ngoing to play “first one to cry \\nwins.” \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\nStarting ... Now. I’m playing too. \\nSo is Miss Patty. \\n\\nMiss Patty nods. \\n\\nThey all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up \\n- Father Leviatch is sobbing. \\n\\nEveryone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry.  \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nI’m sorry… I’m sorry. \\n\\nEXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON. \\n\\nDiana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she \\nand Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides: \\n\\nDIANA \\n\\nI heard that before he became a \\npriest he was married and he had a \\nson named Etienne who died of a \\ndrug overdose at 17 which was maybe \\na suicide but my mom says same \\ndifference if you are so careless \\nwith your life. \\n\\n(a horn honks) \\n\\nOh that’s her! Gotta go, bye guys! \\n\\nLady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a \\nsemi- awkward silence. She sees it’s her Moment. She tries \\nto casually hand Danny a bag but it’s a kind of big bag. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n24. \\n\\nHe pulls out the Conair pink and purple “Hot Sticks.” \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, I almost forgot. I brought you \\nthese  hot  rollers.  For  your  Jim \\nMorrison hair. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThank you so much. \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou’re welcome.  \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nYou’ll have to show me how to use \\nthem. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(weirdly formal) \\nIt would be my pleasure. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThey look like sperms. \\n\\nDANNY (CONT’D) \\n\\nHey! I just remembered I had a \\ndream about you! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nReally?! What happened? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nWe were flying to Disneyland on a \\ngiant carrot.... \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nAwesome! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nI love Disneyland. \\n\\nHe laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms \\nbut it wasn’t so funny to say it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMe too, I think it’s kind of scary \\nbut I also love it. \\n\\nTriumph! They are having a Real Conversation. \\n\\nINT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY \\n\\nMr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. He’s handsome \\nand young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school. \\nLady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks \\nintently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n25. \\n\\nJulie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment. \\nThey are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a A-. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\n(finishing an explanation) \\nDon’t leave me hanging. Can I get \\na nod? That’s good. Maybe even a \\nverbal confirmation? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(too loud) \\n\\nYES. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nGood job, Jules, I could tell from \\nyour work that you even understood \\nthe one you missed! \\n\\nHe kind of winks at her. She blushes. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(looking at her grade) \\n\\nSUCK A DICK. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(to Lady Bird) \\n\\nI like “Jules.” \\n\\nLady Bird looks at her C+. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI just don’t get why I’m not good \\nat math, my Dad is really good at \\nmath. Even Miguel has a math \\ndegree. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nMaybe it’s your Mom’s fault. \\n\\nINT. HOMECOMING DANCE. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT. \\n\\nThere are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting \\non half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc., \\nwear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back) \\nRide the cowboy! \\n\\nLady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - they’re \\ndoing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to “Tha Crossroads.” \\nSuddenly Lady Bird stops. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYou lose! POINT JULIE! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, look\\n\\n\\x0cAcross the dance, there is Danny. He’s wearing chaps, a holster, \\na hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne. \\n\\n26. \\n\\nJulie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nWish me luck. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nLuck. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWanna dance? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nHell, yeah! \\n\\nThey start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup \\ndance alone and then stops. It’s pointless without a buddy. \\nShe falls back and watches. \\n\\nSister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny: \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nSix inches for the Holy Spirit! \\n\\nThey roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady \\nBird close again. She swoons. Life is happening. \\n\\nEXT. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning \\nagainst the gym waiting for their parents. Julie’s Mom pulls \\nup with Uncle Matt. Honks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(to Lady Bird) \\n\\nThat’s us! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNah, my Mom is coming. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nNo she’s not. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(pointed) \\n\\nYes, she is. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nBut the plan was sleepover at - \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIT’S FINE. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n27. \\n\\nLady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(annoyed) \\n\\nOkay, bye then. \\n\\nJulie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves. \\nLady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled \\nsounds of the dance. Then: \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nHave you ever been out of the \\ncountry? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhen I was little, my Dad had a job \\nthat took him to Brazil. I remember \\nfrom the pictures. \\n\\nDANNY \\nI’ve never been out of the \\ncountry. It’s my dream to go \\nto Paris.  \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(sighs) \\n\\nParis. \\n\\nThat’s why I’m learning French. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nMy mom said French wasn’t useful. \\n\\nIt is if you want to go to Paris. \\n\\nDANNY (CONT’D) \\nI still don’t know how to use those \\nrollers you gave me. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, it’s so easy, like after they \\nheat up, you just take your hair \\nand twist the hair and then twirl \\nthe thing like this... \\n\\nThey laugh. \\n\\nShe reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. It’s surprising. \\nThey kiss again. It’s romantic, really romantic. \\n\\nEXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird walks home. She’s smiling so huge and throws her \\nface to the sky and screams. \\n\\nINT. HOUSE. NIGHT. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nMarion and Larry are arguing with a lot of financial \\ndocuments strewn across the kitchen table. \\n\\n28. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n29. \\n\\nLady Bird opens the back door, glowing and shiny from the \\nnight and the kiss. She sneaks past. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nLarry how long will this hold us. \\n\\nLARRY \\nI don’t know... \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell, someone must know. Can the \\nwhole family go on Cobra, even \\nMiguel? What happens if someone \\ngets in an accident? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nI’m not sure - the severance \\npackage I think it expires all at \\nonce, not within the calendar \\nyear... \\n\\nMARION \\nI’ll ask at my work if -- \\n\\nMARION (CONT’D) \\n\\nIs she home? \\n\\nMaybe leave it for tonight... \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNo, she knows better. \\n(getting up) \\n\\nShe cannot sneak around like \\nthis... \\n\\nLady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasn’t \\nsupposed to see this. And she doesn’t want to know any more. \\n\\nSuddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply. \\n\\nMarion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Bird’s room. \\n\\nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all \\nthe lights come on, it’s so bright: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nChristine! You can’t leave your \\nroom like this! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI didn’t... \\n\\n\\x0c30. \\n\\nLady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look \\nlike “I’m sorry, I can’t help you here.” He disappears. \\nMarion picks up her uniform. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNone of these things were put \\naway right, they aren’t nice, \\nCHRISTINE! NOW! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(weakly) \\n\\nMy name is Lady Bird. \\n\\nMARION \\nDon’t lie to me, Christine! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNO, this uniform is going to look \\nlike TRASH on Monday! \\n\\nMARION (CONT’D) \\n\\nThis isn’t right - we can’t treat \\nour clothes like this. I don’t \\nknow what your wealthy friends \\ndo... \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWhy do you care what I do to my \\nclothes? \\n\\nYour father does not have a job. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nHe lost his job, okay? Do you \\nneed him to come in here and \\nexplain that to you? \\n\\nMarion closes the door.. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30. \\n\\nMARION \\nOf course he wouldn’t do it \\nanyway, he’s Mr. Nice Guy. I always \\nhave to be the Bad Guy. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nCan we please talk about this \\ntomorrow? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou can’t look like a rag because \\nthat makes us look like rags. And \\nyou want to know the truth? Here’s \\nthe truth: some of your friends’ \\nfathers could employ your father \\nand they won’t do that if it looks \\nlike his family is trash. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(quietly) \\n\\nDidn’t you ever go to sleep without \\nputting all your clothes away \\nperfectly? Like even once? And \\ndon’t you wish your Mom hadn’t \\ngotten angry? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMy mother was an abusive alcoholic. \\n\\nLady Bird puts all her clothes away while Marion watches. \\n\\nLady Bird has nothing to say to this, Marion wins. \\n\\nINT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR’S OFFICE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird looks at some brochures. The Guidance Counselor \\nlooks at her grades and test scores. \\n\\nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR \\n\\nSo I understand that you’re not \\ninterested in any Catholic \\ncolleges? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo way. Sorry, but yes, no way. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n31. \\n\\nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR \\n\\nThen you’ll be applying to UCs and \\nState schools? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nYes, but also those East Coast \\nliberal arts schools. Like Yale, \\nbut not Yale because I probably \\ncouldn’t get in. \\n\\nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR \\n\\n(laughs) \\n\\nYou definitely couldn’t get in. \\nPart of my job is to help you be \\nrealistic. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThat seems like everyone’s job. \\n\\nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR \\n\\nYour SAT scores are strangely very \\ngood. \\n\\nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR (CONT’D) \\n\\nI’d placed some calls to local \\nalumni of the schools you’re \\ninterested in, but unfortunately \\nall the interviews are taken. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nSo... what does that mean? \\n\\nGUIDANCE COUNSELOR \\n\\nIt means that you’ll have to get in \\non how you look on paper. \\n\\nLady Bird shrugs. \\n\\nINT. THEATRE. DAY. \\n\\nEXT. ROSE GARDEN.

HALLWAYS OF IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY. \\n\\nJulie and Lady Bird wander the hallways. Julie shoves a \\ncupcake in her mouth, so does Lady Bird. The wander and chew \\ncontemplatively. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(not really to anyone) \\n\\nIt’s normal to not touch a penis. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(looks around, notices \\n\\neveryone is gone) \\nI have to go to class. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBut I have free period! \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI need to pass history! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI think we’re done with the \\nlearning portion of high school. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI’m gonna go. \\n\\nNO! I HATE BEING ALONE! \\n\\nLADY  BIRD \\n\\n \\n\\nBye, love you. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nJulie takes off. Lady Bird lazily walks the halls. \\n\\nShe sees her empty math classroom and sees that Mr. Bruno \\nisn’t there. She ducks inside. Notices his grade binder on \\nthe desk. Snatches it and then runs. \\n\\nShe dumps it into one of the big trash cans and hurries away. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. THRIFT TOWN.

What says “rich \\npeople Thanksgiving”? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIt’s just such a shame that you’re \\nspending your last Thanksgiving \\nwith a family you’ve never met \\ninstead of us, but I guess you want \\nit that way. \\n\\n(clocks her walking) \\n\\nAre you tired? \\n\\nThey keep looking. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo. \\n\\nA saleswoman, Joyce, calls out: \\n\\nJOYCE SALESWOMAN \\n\\nHey Marion! \\n\\nMarion waves to the saleswoman. Her voice is so warm and \\nfriendly with other people who are not her daughter: \\n\\nMARION \\nHey Joyce!

Danny tries to converse: \\n\\nBut there are actual train tracks. \\n\\nMarion’s face contorts. This is painful. \\n\\nJust then, Lady Bird enters, looking beautiful in her vintage \\ndress. She holds a duffel bag. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(now upset with her) \\n\\nWhat in the hell is in that duffel \\nbag? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n40. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDon’t worry about it, Jeez! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nMy grandmother will love that \\ndress. \\n\\nINT.

Oh my god.  \\n\\nShe meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like she’s \\na queen but pulls back just in time: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYour house is my favorite in all \\nof East Sacramento.  \\n\\n \\n \\nLady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very \\nprominent Ronald Regan poster: \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nIs this... a joke? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nNo. \\n\\nLady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds \\na napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower. \\nDanny’s Grandmother notices, and IS TOTALLY INTO IT. Soon, \\nLady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way, \\nteaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Danny’s \\nGrandmother enjoys Lady Bird. \\n\\nINT. DANNY’S CAR. NIGHT \\n\\nLady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the \\nshow. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg \\nfrom his house.

There are some ironic \\nturkeys pinned up on the stage. \\n\\nThe “cool kids” are there. They don’t say hi but they don’t \\nshun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah \\nRuiz. He’s singing pretty terrible songs about her with his \\nband, the pretentiously named L’enfance Nue. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(whispered to Julie) \\n\\nIf Danny and I get married and then \\nhis Grandma died, I’d inherit the \\nDream House. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWouldn’t his parent’s get it? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(realizing) \\n\\nOh yeah, we’d have to kill them. \\nAnd kill his older brothers, too. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n43. \\n\\nKyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really \\ninto it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this \\nKyle Scheible. She feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to him. She looks \\nat Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else \\ngoing on with Kyle Scheible. She’s not sure, maybe it’s the \\npot. Maybe not. REMEMBER KYLE, Lady Bird will. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who \\nwas looking at him. She turns quickly away. \\n\\nJULIE \\n(to no one) \\n\\nWhere is Mr. Bruno’s wife...? \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making “Smart \\nOnes” frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat, \\neveryone with their own spoon taking bites out of the \\ndifferent platters. \\n\\nThen Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly \\nannounces herself: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nHow’s it going? \\n\\nNo one can say anything, it’s almost like they’re frozen. \\nFinally Lady Bird is able to squeak out: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMom, we really can’t talk right now. \\n\\nThey all dissolve into giggles again. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed \\nyou, Lady Bird. \\n\\nMarion leaves. She’s hurt and angry but mostly hurt. \\n\\nEXT. LADY BIRD’S FRONT YARD. NIGHT \\n\\nThe kids all pile back into Danny’s car. Lady Bird waves \\ngoodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird \\nshivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly \\nsmoking: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n (curious) \\n\\nWhy does that cigarette look so \\nweird? Like not like cigarette? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nShelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs. \\n\\n44. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nIt’s a clove. Lick your lips. \\nThat’s why they’re sweet. \\n\\n(then) \\n\\nYour Mom was really sad you weren’t \\nhere tonight for Thanksgiving. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWell, she hates me. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nShe has a big heart, your Mom. She \\ntook me in after my parents freaked \\nout about, whatever, pre-marital \\nsex. I admire her. \\n\\nLady Bird doesn’t fight Shelly. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER. GIRLS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. ` \\n\\nBuzzing in the girls dressing room. It’s opening night! \\n\\nThey are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging \\n“opening night” gifts. The girls are applying too much \\nmakeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER. BOYS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. \\n\\nThe boys also get ready.

It’s time for the show. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. \\n\\nThe show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark. \\nThe students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up \\nthe first chord. \\n\\nMERRILY WE ROLL ALONG is actually a pretty upsetting and \\nadult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other \\n“fabulous” girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair. \\nThere’s lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and \\nsing their hearts out \\n\\nEveryone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the \\nshow as opposed to the show itself. \\n\\nThe audience includes the whole of Lady Bird’s family, \\nJulie’s Mom and Uncle Matt, Danny’s whole Irish-Catholic \\nclan. Everyone is proud. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. \\n\\nMingling after the show. Some of the administrators look \\nscandalized. \\n\\nJulie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful \\nand confident: \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nThere she is! Jules, wow! You were \\nso good. I couldn’t believe that. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nThank you... \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\nJules, I’d like you to meet my \\nwife, Becky. Becky this is Jules, \\none of my brightest students. \\n\\nBECKY \\n\\nNice to meet you. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(devastated) \\n\\nNice to meet you, too. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nHow we doing? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n46. \\n\\nBECKY \\nYeah, I’m a little tired. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nOkay, I gotta get her home, we’ve \\ngot the little one, but great \\nwork Jules. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(as they leave) \\n\\nCongratulations. \\n\\nJulie is humiliated, and doesn’t quite know why. She sits \\ndown next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He \\nwatches people pass him by: \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\nThey didn’t understand it \\n\\nINT. DINER. NIGHT. \\n\\nThe entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening \\nnight, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They \\nare being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game. Lady Bird \\nand Danny make towers with the sugar packets. Julie and Greg \\nhang out together: they’re both the “extra” friends. Everyone \\nis giddy and happy. \\n\\nINT. DINER GIRLS BATHROOM.

MEN’S ROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird opens the door and opens a stall and there, in \\nfront of her: Danny and Greg making out hard. Julie comes \\ntumbling in from behind. \\n\\nINT. JULIE’S ROOM. JULIE’S HOUSE. NIGHT. \\n\\nThey both cry. They listen to “Crash Into Me” by Dave \\nMatthews and sob. \\n\\nThe song ends and Lady Bird starts it over. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. \\n\\nThey perform the next night. \\n\\nNo fun. It’s no fun because their boyfriends are gay. \\n\\nINT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird gets her cast off with a saw.

We \\nwanted to, well, it’s just a little \\nsmall this year. \\n\\nLarry opens his gift. \\n\\n(laughing) \\n\\nIt’s just what I needed, honey. \\n\\nHe holds up a throw pillow that says “Golfers Don’t Diet They \\nJust Exist On Greens.” He laughs. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(laughing, too) \\n\\nIt makes me laugh. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRD’S ROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nA gentle knock on the door. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) \\n\\nDad? Come in. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\n(entering) \\n\\nHow did you know it was me? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMom doesn’t knock. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\n(laughs) \\nNo, she doesn’t. \\n\\nHe gives her an envelope. Quietly says: \\n\\nLARRY (CONT’D) \\n\\nHere they are, your completed \\nfinancial aid applications. Merry \\nChristmas. \\n\\nLady Bird throws her arms around Larry. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThank you! Thank you! \\n\\nLARRY \\nDo you need money for the \\napplications? Because I can help \\nwith that, too, I just need to -- \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n49. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n-- no, no, I’ve got that, summer \\njobs covered it. \\n\\nINT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUEL’S ROOM. COMPUTER. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses \\nthings, puts materials in envelopes. \\n\\nHe indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nThis is why we have computer shut- \\noff time - this is our room. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOkay, okay, just can you drive me \\nto the post office on J?

I like your band with Jonah \\nRuiz, L\\'enfance Nue? \\n\\n(she pronounces it \\n\\nLenfance New) \\n\\nKYLE \\n(correcting her \\npronunciation) \\n\\nL’enfance Nue. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI saw your Thanksgiving show. My \\nname’s Lady Bird. \\n\\n\\x0cThey shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between \\nthem. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before. She gets \\nall R&B songs ever written in one moment. \\n\\n50. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nIt’s weird you shake hands.  \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n(lying) \\n\\nYeah, I’m friends with Jenna and \\nshe’s always talking about how \\ngreat your band is so I wanted to \\ncheck it out. \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nJenna’s hella tight.

Lady Bird \\nsits next to Julie and sings in the choir and scans for Kyle. \\n\\nFrom under her choir robe, Lady Bird pulls out “The People’s \\nHistory of the United States” and reads it while the priest \\ndelivers the homily. \\n\\nDanny tries to make eye contact with Lady Bird but she coldly \\nlooks away. Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her \\nboyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of \\nthis thing, this popular-straight-kid thing she’s always been \\noutside of. \\n\\nLady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed. \\n\\nINT. HOMEROOM. DAY. \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nThe first time we did it was at his \\nlake house last summer. It was so \\nfunny... \\n\\nJulie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch: \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nFrom Uncle Matt. I think he and my \\nMom are fighting, so enjoy these \\nlunches while you can. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, no thanks, I’m trying to lose \\nweight. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nReally? \\n\\nBut Lady Bird isn’t paying attention. She’s angling towards \\nJenna Walton, the tan, who holds court: \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nYeah, sex is not a big deal, it’s \\njust my mom called during it! \\n\\nEveryone laughs. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEveryone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in: \\n\\n51. \\n\\nJENNA (CONT’D) \\nIt was on my cell phone, she got it \\nfor emergencies. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDid you pick up? \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nYeah, I was like, \"um, Mom, I ca not \\nreally talk right now.\" \\n\\nWhat?

I’m \\nnot going to a fucking university \\nthat’s famous for it’s fucking \\nAGRICULTURAL SCHOOL. \\n\\nShe runs out, furious. She’d kick the computer if she could. \\n\\nAND MIGUEL AND SHELLY YOU’LL NEVER \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) (CONT’D) \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\nGET JOBS WITH ALL THAT SHIT IN YOUR \\nFACE! \\n\\nMiguel self-consciously puts his hand to his nose-ring, \\nrotating it. Shelly mentally tallies all her piercings. \\n\\n62. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. JENNA\\'S HOUSE. NIGHT. \\n\\nA fancy McMansion, giant but not utterly tasteless. A low-key \\nhouse party. Lady Bird wanders through the palatial house, \\nlooking for Jenna. Runs up to her: \\n\\n63. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHey!  \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\n(hugging her) \\n\\nHi! Help yourself to anything in \\nthe fridge. My parent’s are \\nupstairs but they don’t care if you \\ndrink. \\n\\nShe nods and moves on. What she’s looking for is Kyle of \\ncourse. She spots Kyle outside, reading a book and smoking. \\n\\nEXT. JENNA\\'S HOUSE. BY THE POOL. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird casually slinks outside and lights up a clove, like \\nshe does it all the time. Kyle notices like he was meant to. \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nI hate that shit. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBut you smoke. \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nHand rolled cigarettes - never \\nindustrially produced and never \\ncloves. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhat’s wrong with cloves? \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nYou can’t inhale cloves. What’s \\nthe point? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh... \\n\\nKYLE \\nYou’re not supposed to. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCloves were what I first smoked, \\nwhen I was young, so you know, \\nforce of habit. \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nHuh. Well it has fiber glass. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n64. \\n\\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nReally? \\n \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nRolling your own is best. Also I’m \\ntrying to, as much as is possible, \\nnot participate in our economy. I \\ndon’t like money. I am trying to \\nlive by bartering alone. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBut doesn’t Catholic school cost \\nmoney? \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nYeah  the  diocese  were  not  super \\ninto it. \\n\\n(then) \\n\\nIt mattered to my Dad that I go to \\nXavier, so just trying to make him \\nhappy. \\n\\nShe sits down next to him. He touches her face. She breathes \\nout hard. He kisses her and she kisses back. \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nAnother part of the house: Kyle and Lady Bird are making out \\nfull on. She wants it, but not so fast: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI don’t want to have sex yet. I \\nhaven’t had sex yet. With another \\nperson. \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nNo, me neither. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n \\nReally? \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYeah. \\n\\nCool. \\n\\nThey start making out again. They fall into a door and it \\nreveals THE FAMOUS TANNING BED. Lady Bird laughs. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nOh my god! It’s the tanning bed! \\nJulie will love this! \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nWho’s Julie? \\n\\nINT. BATHROOM. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird sits on the edge of the tub and looks at a picture \\nof Kyle from the “Xavier” insert in the Immaculate Heart of \\nMary Yearbook.  \\n\\nJust Lady Bird’s feet on either side of the tub-tile, the \\nwater streaming down. It’s obvious what she’s doing. \\n\\nShe’s out. She has towels wrapped around her body and head. \\nShe rummages around the medicine cabinet. She sees a pill \\nbottle and looks at it. It’s antidepressants for her Dad. She \\nputs it back, carefully. \\n\\n65. \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nMarion clocks the towels around Lady Bird’s head and body: \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\nLady Bird! You can’t lock yourself \\nin there! We have one bathroom! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(opening the door) \\n\\nSorry, sorry, sorry! \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nIt’s just this is the only place I \\ncan get any privacy. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nDo you really need to use two \\ntowels? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, I guess no. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIf you need two towels you just \\nhave to say so because this affects \\nmy whole day, I have to do laundry \\nbefore work and I need to know if \\nthere are more towels I need to \\nwash. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI just need one, sorry. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOK, well let me get to the mirror, \\nI gotta get going. \\n\\nLady Bird backs up, watches Marion put on makeup. \\n\\n66. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOk. \\n\\nThey regard each other.  \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhen do you think is a normal time \\nto have sex? \\n\\nMARION \\n(drops her mascara) \\n\\nYou’re having sex? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo! \\n\\nMARION \\nUh, college is good, I think \\ncollege. Use protection. Like we \\ntalked about. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nIs Dad depressed? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(looking from the mirror) \\n\\nWhy do you ask that? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThe pills... they have Dad’s name \\non them. \\n\\nMARION \\nDad’s been struggling with \\ndepression for years. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI didn’t know that. \\n\\nMarion’s not sure she should talk about it, but then does: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n67. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMoney is not life’s report card. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHe’s depressed about money? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nBeing successful doesn’t mean \\nanything in and of itself. It just \\nmeans that you’re successful. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(confused) \\n\\nYeah, but then you’re successful. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nBut that doesn’t mean you’re happy. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nBut he’s not happy. \\n\\nEXT. JENNA’S HOUSE. POOL. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird and Jenna messing around in her big pool, splashing \\neach other, being teenage ladies-of-leisure. Lady Bird is \\nfeeling the weight of her life, the heft of it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI have to get out of Sacramento. \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBecause it’s soul-killing. It’s the \\nmid-west of California. \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nIsn’t there a thing, like: “think \\nglobally, act locally.” \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI feel that the person who said \\nthat didn’t live in Sacramento. \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nI love it here. I want to send my \\ndaughters to Immaculate Heart. I \\nwant to be, you know, be a mom. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n68. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nAt least go to San Francisco. \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nI do not like hills. \\n\\nJenna disappears under the water. Lady Bird considers that \\nperhaps Jenna is not such a good fit for her as a friend, \\neven if she is popular and cool. They aren’t the same. \\n\\nINT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY. \\n\\nJulie’s desk is empty beside Lady Bird. She misses her real \\nfriend. \\n\\nINT. ST. FRANCIS HALLWAYS. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird sees Julie walking in the hallway with Darlene, the \\nweird girl from choir. She calls out: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nJulie! Julie! Julie, hey! \\n\\nDARLENE \\n\\n(aggressive) \\n\\nWhat do you want from Julie? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDarlene can you excuse us? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nDarlene, stay. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWhy aren’t you in Algebra II? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI switched sections. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhy? \\n\\nSo Darlene stays, her creepy cow eyes taking in the scene. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n69. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nAren’t Jenna and Kyle enough? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI’m sorry that you’re jealous. \\n\\nHA! Jenna is a moron, you know. \\n\\nShe’s not. She’s in AP Calculus. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nShe’s a moron in a deeper sense. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou don’t even know her.  \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n-- Miss Patty assigned you a role, \\nby the way. You just never showed \\nup to claim it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhat role? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n“The Tempest.” \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThere is no role of “The Tempest.” \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nIt’s the titular role! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, it’s a made up thing so we all \\ncan participate. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nCan’t do anything unless you’re the \\ncenter of attention, can you? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nYeah, well, you know your mom is \\ntits? They are FAKE. TOTALLY FAKE. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nShe made a bad decision at 19! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nTwo bad decisions. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n70. \\n\\nJulie leaves with Darlene. Lady Bird is furious and \\nrighteous. \\n\\nINT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY GYM. DAY. \\n\\nEveryone sits on the bleachers for a “special assembly.” \\nJenna and Lady Bird sit together. Lady Bird loves being seen \\nwith her at this public event. \\n\\nA woman is speaking - she is heavy-set with a “wedge” \\nhaircut. She holds up models of fetuses. \\n\\n\\x0c70. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nAnd at fifteen, this girl was \\npregnant. She decided that she \\nwas going to get an abortion. It \\nmade sense. It was the right \\nthing to do. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(whispering) \\n\\nLet me guess she didn’t get it. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nAnd she was sitting there waiting \\nfor the doctor to come in and \\nsomething deep inside her said NO. \\n\\nBingo. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nAnyone want to guess who this woman \\nis? \\n\\nHands shoot up. \\n\\nCASEY (CONT’D) \\n\\nThe young lady right here. \\n\\nYOUNG LADY \\n\\nYou? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n71. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nNo, it was not me. \\n\\nANOTHER YOUNG LADY \\n\\nUm, your friend? \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nNo, the girl in the story was... my \\nmother. \\n\\nGasps from the audience. \\n\\nCASEY (CONT’D) \\nI am that baby that she decided not \\nto abort.  \\n\\nCut to: Laminated graphics about abortion are being passed \\naround. \\n\\nUnfortunately this comment was loud enough for Casey to hear. \\n\\nCASEY (CONT’D) \\nThat could have been me, that could \\nhave been my fate. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(to Jenna) \\n\\nJust because something looks ugly \\ndoesn’t mean that it is morally \\nwrong. \\n\\nCASEY \\nWhat did you say, ma’am? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNothing. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nPlease share. \\n\\nLady Bird looks at Jenna and decides that she’s really going \\nto impress her: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(loud) \\n\\nI said “Just because something \\nlooks ugly doesn’t mean that it is \\nmorally wrong.” \\n\\nThe girls are shocked and embarrassed, but laughing too. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n72. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nYou think dead children aren’t \\nmorally wrong? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo... \\n\\nShe’s going all in: \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONT’D) \\n\\nI’m just saying that if you took up \\nclose pictures of my vagina while I \\nwas on my period it would be \\ndisturbing but it doesn’t make it \\nwrong. \\n\\nGASPS! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Bird’s escalating mania. \\nShe briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed, \\nbut uses her shame to plow ahead rather than turn back. \\n\\nCASEY \\n(horrified) \\n\\nExcuse me? What did you say? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nListen, if your mother had had the \\nabortion we would not have to sit \\nthrough this stupid assembly? \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\nSuspended?!

How much you’re \\nTHROWING away every day? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nGive me a number. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWhat? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nGIVE ME A NUMBER! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nI don’t understand. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou give me a number for how much \\nit cost to raise me, and I’m going \\nto get older and make a lot of \\nmoney and write you a check for \\nwhat I owe you so that I NEVER \\nHAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. \\n\\nLady Bird, tired of being berated, furiously gets a pen and a \\npiece of paper, poised to write, cuts Marion off: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n75. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nI highly doubt that you will be \\nable to get a job good enough to do \\nthat. \\n\\nLady Bird screams and raises her hand at her mother. Brings \\nit down without striking. Leaves the room without a sound. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRD’S HOUSE. EARLY AFTERNOON. \\n\\nLady Bird lounging - watching television. Life during \\nSuspension.

Do you believe in God? \\n\\nCOLLEGE BOY \\n\\nNo. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhy not? \\n\\nCOLLEGE BOY \\n\\nBecause it’s ridiculous. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(shaking her head) \\n\\nPeople will call each other by \\nnames their parents made up for \\nthem but they won’t believe in \\nGod. \\n\\nCOLLEGE BOY \\n\\nWhat’s your name? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(considering) \\n\\nChristine. My name is Christine. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\nCOLLEGE BOY \\nI’m David. \\n \\n\\nThey shake hands. \\n\\nYou shake. \\n\\nDAVID \\n\\nI shake. \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nDAVID \\n\\nWhere are you from? \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nSacramento. \\n\\nDAVID \\n\\nSorry, where? \\n\\nThe music was too loud, he hadn’t heard her. Second try: \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nSan Francisco. \\n\\nDAVID \\n\\nCool! San Francisco is a great \\ncity. \\n\\nShe is immediately ashamed, but pleased with her social \\nsuccess. She drinks everything. \\n\\nLady Bird is very drunk now. She leans out the window. David \\ndoes, too. She yells at the sky. \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBRUCE! \\n\\nCOLLEGE BOY \\nNo, my name is David. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRD’S DORM. NIGHT. \\n\\nBack in her dorm with the David. She is so drunk that she is \\nhalf way between passing out and throwing up. \\n\\nDavid is flipping through her giant CD case. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nDAVID \\n\\nJesus Christ you have bad music. \\nIt’s all Greatest Hits. \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nBut they’re the Greatest, what’s \\nwrong with that? \\n\\nDavid puts down the CD case and starts making out with her. \\nShe throws up all over him. \\n\\nDAVID \\n\\nOh, god, oh god! \\n\\nHe gets up and runs away, out of the room. \\n\\nINT. DORM ROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nChristine being loaded onto some kind of strap down chair. \\nShe is crying. \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nI’m sorry. \\n\\nINT. HOSPITAL. NIGHT. \\n\\nChristine looks up, half awake. A nurse comes into focus. \\n\\nNURSE \\n\\nWhat do you want us to do, she’s \\ndrunk. \\n\\nChristine passes out again. \\n\\nINT. HOSPITAL. DAY. \\n\\nChristine opens her eyes. Looks at her bracelet. Sits up. A \\nchild sits across from her with something definitely wrong \\nwith his eye. She winces. \\n\\nShe stands. It seems like she can just walk out. She does. \\n\\nEXT. NYC STREET. DAY. \\n\\nChristine is hung over but basically okay. Stops a man: \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nWhat day is it? \\n\\nNYC MAN \\n\\nSunday. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\nShe walks past a church. People are filing in. So does she. \\n\\nINT. CHURCH. DAY. \\n\\nSnippets of a sermon, some donation baskets. The choir gets \\nup to sing “Blessed Assurance.” \\n\\nChristine listens and then cries, hard, and then starts \\nlaughing and singing along. It turns out that her life is \\njust beginning. \\n\\nShe ducks into the entry-way of the church. Gets out her \\nphone, calls her home phone. It rings and rings. She leaves a \\nmessage: \\n\\nCHRISTINE \\n\\nHi Mom and Dad, it’s me. Christine. \\nIt’s the name you gave me. It’s a \\ngood one. Dad, this is more for Mom \\n- Hey Mom: did you feel emotional \\nthe first time that you drove in \\nSacramento? I did and I wanted to \\ntell you, but we weren’t really \\ntalking when it happened. All \\nthose bends I’ve known my whole \\nlife, and stores, and the whole \\nthing. But I wanted to tell you. I \\nlove you. Thank you, I’m... thank \\nyou. \\n\\nHangs up and listens from the back of the church while the \\nchoir continues singing. \\n\\nCredits. \\n\\n\\x0c'"
