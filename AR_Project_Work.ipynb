EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nOne of those anonymous trucker motels along-side I-5 through \\ncentral California. Itâs late summer, 2002. Two women sleep \\ntogether in a bed. Christine, aka Lady Bird, 17 years old. \\nHer Mom, Marion, the age of Lady Birdâs Mom. A modern-day \\nromantic Mary Cassatt rip-off painting of motherhood. \\n\\n \\nLADY BIRD (V.O.) \\n\\nDo you think I look like Iâm from \\nSacramento? \\n\\nNow theyâre awake. Lady Bird stares at her re. Marion makes \\nthe bed. \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou are from Sacramento. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(re: making the bed) \\n\\nYou donât have to do that. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell itâs nice to make things neat \\nand clean. \\n\\nMarion is making hospital corners. Lady Bird sits on the \\njust made bed. Marion sits beside her, moves the hair out of \\nLady Birdâs eyes. \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nReady to go home? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nReady. \\n\\nINT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. CALIFORNIA. DAY. \\n\\nThe last sentences of The Grapes of Wrath. \\n\\nAUDIOBOOK \\n\\nâHer hand moved behind his head and \\nsupported it. Her fingers moved \\ngently in his hair. She looked up \\nand across the barn, and her lips \\ncame together and smiled \\nmysteriously.â You have been \\nlistening to âThe Grapes of Wrathâ \\nby John Steinbeck. If you... \\n\\n(pause) \\n \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2. \\n\\nLady Bird ejects the tape, returns it to the case from the \\npublic library. They are both crying. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(looking on the back) \\n\\nOur college trip took 21 hours and \\n5 minutes. \\n\\nThey laugh and then wipe their tears. Itâs a nice moment - \\nthey both had the same emotion. Lady Bird immediately starts \\nlooking for a good song on the radio. \\n\\nLady Bird stares out the window, now sullen. Then: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(turning it off) \\nHey, you know, letâs just \\nsit with what we heard? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(bristling) \\n\\nAre you serious? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWe donât need to be constantly \\nentertaining ourselves, do we? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI wish I could live through \\nsomething. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nArenât you? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNope. The only exciting thing about \\n2002 is that itâs a palindrome. \\n \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOk fine, yours is the worst life of \\nall, you win. \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIâm sorry Iâm not perfect. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNobody is asking you to be perfect! \\nJust considerate would do. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh so now youâre mad? Because \\nI wanted to listen to music? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nItâs just that youâre being \\nridiculous, you have a \\ngreat life. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n3. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(really picking a fight) \\nI donât even want to go to school \\nin  this  state  anyway,  I  hate \\nCalifornia. I  want  to  go  to  the \\nEast Coast. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYour Dad and I will barely be able \\nto afford in-state tuition. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nThere are loans, scholarships! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYour brother, your very smart \\nbrother, canât even find a job -- \\n\\nHe and Shelly work. They have jobs. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nImmaculate Heart is already a \\nluxury. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nImmaculate FART. You wanted that, \\nnot me! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMiguel saw someone knifed in front \\nof him at Sac High, is that what \\nyou want? Youâre telling me that \\nyou want to see someone knifed \\nright in front of you? \\n\\nTHEY BAG AT THE GROCERY STORE. \\nThat is not a career and they went \\nto BERKELEY.MARION \\n\\nYour fatherâs company is laying people off right and left, did \\nyou know that? No of course not because you donât care about \\nanyone but yourself. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n4. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHe barely saw that. I want to go \\nwhere culture is, like New York. \\n\\nMARION \\nHow in the world did I raise \\nsuch a SNOB? \\n\\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOr at least Connecticut or \\nNew Hampshire. Where writers \\nlive in the woods. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou couldnât get into those schools \\nanyway. \\n\\nMOM! \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou canât even pass your driverâs \\ntest. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nBecause you wouldnât let me \\npractice enough! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nThe way you work, the way you donât \\nwork, youâre not even worth state \\ntuition, Christine. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCALL ME LADY BIRD LIKE YOU SAID YOU \\nWOULD! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou should just go to City College, \\nwith your work ethic. City College \\nand then to jail then back to City \\nCollege. Maybe youâd learn how to \\npull yourself up and not expect \\neveryone to do everything for \\nyou... \\n\\nMY NAME IS LADY BIRD! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION (CONT\\'D) \\n\\nWell actually, itâs not, and \\nitâs ridiculous. Your name \\nis Christine. \\n\\nThey slow for a stop light and Lady Bird dramatically opens \\nthe door and rolls out of the car. Marion screams. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n5. \\n\\nINT. IMMACULATE HEART OF MARY. DAY. \\n\\nClose on a cast. In very small letters is written âfuck you, \\nmom.â The cast belongs to Lady Bird. She follows along with \\nthe mass. \\n\\nCREDITS run over this joint liturgy between Immaculate Heart \\nof Mary (girls school) and Xavier (boys school) and beginning \\nof the year activities. \\n\\nA sea of catholic girlsâ school uniforms in bleachers during \\ncandidate speeches. \\n\\nCANDIDATE \\n(finishing her speech) \\nA Vote for Amanda is a vote for \\nboys. Boys and healthy vending \\nmachines because no one wants a \\nmuffin with that many calories. \\n\\nLady Bird waits her turn to make her speech, and makes eye \\ncontact with Julie in the crowd, a sweet, chubby 17 year old. \\nHer best friend. \\n\\n \\n5 classrooms, 5 syllabi, 5 âbeginning of senior yearâ \\nspeeches from the teachers. A few teachers are nuns. \\n\\nBack in the church, Lady Bird looks intently at an image of \\nJesus. The priest gives his homily. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\nThere are the classics: St. \\nAugustine, of course, and Aquinas. \\nMy favorite, Kierkegaard - wait \\nuntil you hear his love story - it \\nwill make you swoon. \\n\\nPRIEST \\n\\nWeâre afraid we wonât get into the \\ncollege of our choice, weâre afraid \\nwe wonât be loved, we wonât be \\nliked, we wonât succeed. \\n\\nEveryone takes communion. Lady Bird approaches and crosses \\nher arms so she just gets a blessing, not real communion, \\nsheâs not Catholic. Lady Bird watches the boys get communion. \\nItâs somehow sexy, opening their mouths to receive the wafer. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN (V.O.) \\nSome of the students were disturbed \\nby your posters. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. VICE-PRINCIPAL SISTER SARAH-JOANâS OFFICE. DAY. \\n\\nSister Sarah-Joan, in a traditional habit, holds up some of \\nLady Birdâs campaign materials. \\n\\n6. \\n\\nReveal of the poster: Lady Birdâs head on a bird body. \\nAnother shows her Catholic-uniformed body with a bird head. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nItâs just a bird head on a lady \\nbody or vice versa. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nI think itâs a little upsetting... \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nItâs my tradition to run for \\noffice. Donât worry, I wonât win. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nThatâs not what Iâm worried about. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(worried) \\n\\nThis wonât mess with my \\nscholarship, will it? \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nNo, youâre okay there. \\n\\n(trying to be helpful) \\n\\nYou have a performative streak, I \\nthink. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI think that too. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nMaybe youâd enjoy theatre arts... \\nThey are having auditions for the \\nfall musical. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDo we have that here? \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nItâs a collaborative effort with \\nthe men at Xavier. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHow am I a senior and not know we \\nhave that? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n7. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nPerhaps you havenât always been an \\nactive part of this community. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nThey do a fall musical and a spring \\nplay and from what I hear itâs a \\nreal blast. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhat Iâd really like is to be on \\nMath Olympiad. \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\n(gently) \\n\\nBut math isnât something that you \\nare terribly strong in? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThat we know of YET. \\n\\nCLOSE ON A LIST. \\n\\nSign ups for auditions for the fall musical. A hand reaches \\nup and takes the pen attached and writes, in all caps: \\n\\nCHRISTINE âLADY BIRDâ McPHERSON \\n\\nAnd then another hand reaches up and writes: \\n\\nJULIANNE âJULIEâ PICKETT \\n\\nReveal Julie and Lady Bird debating this: \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) \\n\\nâJulieâ doesnât need to be in \\nquotes. \\n\\nJULIE (O.S.) \\n\\nBut itâs not my real name. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nItâs not the same thing. \\n\\nJULIE \\n(shaking her head) \\n\\nIâm not sure youâre right... \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n8. \\n\\nEXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. LATE AFTERNOON. \\n\\nJulie and Lady Bird walk through the âfancyâ neighborhood, \\nâThe Fabulous Forties.â They stop in front of this very \\nspecific house - it is the Dream House: It is three stories \\nand blue, with white shutters and a big American Flag. It \\nlooks like nothing bad would ever happen in this house. \\n\\nJULIE \\nI love this neighborhood. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYeah, itâs so beautiful. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nIf I lived here I would definitely \\nhave my wedding in the backyard. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIâd have friends over all the time \\nto study and eat snacks. Iâd be \\nlike âMOM WEâRE TAKING THE SNACKS \\nUPSTAIRS TO THE TV ROOM.â \\n\\nJULIE \\nIâd have my own bathroom. \\n\\nCHECKER \\n\\nI canât stop you dicks from hanging \\nout here but quit wrinkling all the \\nmagazines! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWhen Iâm in this store, Iâm not \\nyour sister - Iâm a customer, \\nMiguel! Iâm always right! \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nEver since she moved in, your \\nbrother and Shelly are becoming \\nthe same person. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo way. \\n\\nINT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING. \\n\\nJulie and Lady Bird browse magazines in an empty checkout \\naisle. A Checker calls out to them: \\n\\nThis is Miguel. Lady Birdâs brother. 22, Latino, clearly \\nadopted. Julie watches him and his girlfriend, Shelly Yuhan, \\n22, a Bagger: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nShelly and Miguel have the same asymmetrical hair-cut and \\nâinterestingâ piercings. Vaguely punk looking. Seem like \\ntheyâre wearing black leather jackets even when they arenât. \\n\\n9. \\n\\nThe girls look at a model in the magazine. She poses in \\nfront of the New York City skyline. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nYeah, okay, maybe. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(re: magazine) \\n\\nSee, why I donât look like that? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nJust once Iâd like to have the \\nsong âNew York Grooveâ play and \\nfeel like it really applies to \\nmy life. \\n\\nYouâve never even been to New York. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThatâs why Iâm applying to New York \\ncolleges - do you know if Sarah \\nLawrence is actually IN the city? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYour parents would pay for that? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nScholarships, financial aid. Iâll \\nfigure it out. My Mom thinks I \\ncanât get in but she is sorely \\nmistaken. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWhat about terrorism? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDonât be a Republican. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nIâm probably just going to go to \\nCity College. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n(almost yelling)  \\n\\nPUT THE MAGAZINE BACK.SHIT. \\n\\nINT. PSYCH HOSPITAL. EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nMarion yawns. Luis, a large Filipino man, approaches her: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n10. \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nYou doing okay, mama? \\n\\nMARION \\nYes, but that was terrifying \\nwasnât it? Thank god you were \\nthere. I guess I canât have \\npencils anymore.  \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nYeah, gotta go back to just felt \\ntip markers. Crayola. \\n\\nMarion suddenly remembers she has something, she hand Luis a \\nsmall bag: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOh Luis this is for you! I got it \\nfor the baby, I couldnât resist it.  \\n\\nHe pulls out a frilly pink dress for a toddler. \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nShe loves pink! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell, itâs really more for you and \\nAndrea than it is for the baby, and \\nIâm sorry I didnât have time to \\nwrap it.... \\n\\nLUIS \\n\\nNo, itâs perfect. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nSee you tomorrow... I mean, later? \\n\\nLuis just laughs. \\n\\nINT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nMarion drives back home. It is romantic somehow. She loves \\nthese streets, loves the turns she knows so well. When sheâs \\nnot resenting the stuck-ness of her own life she has an \\nenormous capacity to love it. Remember this moment with \\nMarion. \\n\\nEXT. LADY BIRDâS NEIGHBORHOOD. EARLY MORNING. \\n\\nMarion drives up. Women are watering their lawns, getting the \\npaper, doing yard work, touching their flowers. Solidly \\nmiddle class. Marion waves to neighbors. They wave back. She \\npicks up the mail, bills, papers, etc. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. BATHROOM. MORNING. \\n\\nDad (50s, name: Larry) brushes his teeth. Marion perched on \\nthe edge of the tub with a newspaper and a stack of mail, \\ngoing through it. \\n\\n11. \\n\\nLARRY \\nDid you know toothpaste is \\nbasically ineffective? Itâs like \\nsucking on a mint. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(to Larry, shaking her \\n\\nhead) \\n\\nMike Kerry died. I didnât know he \\nwas sick again. \\n\\nLARRY \\nHow old was he? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOnly fifty-six. \\n\\nKnocking at the door. \\n\\nMIGUEL (O.S.) \\n\\nCan Shelly and I get in there? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIn a minute honey Dad and I are \\nstill in here! \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\n(re: Mike) \\nThatâs too young. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(calling) \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI AM DRESSED. \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD YOU BETTER BE DRESSED! \\n \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nIâll send them a note. \\n\\n(a little softer) \\n\\nDo you think that Shelly and Miguel \\nhave sex on the pullout couch? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n12. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nOh yeah. \\n\\nMarion laughs at Larryâs subtle joke. He laughs at her \\nlaughter. They like each other. \\n\\nINT. KITCHEN. MORNING. \\n\\nMiguel and Shelly eat cereal. Larry reads the paper. Marion \\nmakes Lady Birdâs breakfast and her lunch. \\n\\nWhy canât I just make the eggs? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nBecause you take too long and make \\na big mess and then I have to clean \\nit up. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\n(small voice) \\n\\nEggs arenât good for the \\nenvironment, anyway. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(too loud) \\n\\nWHAT? \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nYou heard her. \\n\\nMARION \\n(placing the eggs) \\nHere, eat quickly, PLEASE. \\n\\nLARRY \\n(re: paper) \\n\\nLook at all these pictures. Every \\nnewspaper looks like USA Today. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nShelly and I are trying to be \\nvegan. Hence the soy milk. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou wear leather jackets. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n13. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nTheyâre vintage. It doesnât support \\nthe industry. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(poking at the eggs) \\n\\nThey arenât done, thereâs white \\nstuff. \\n \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nYou know how you love Brambles? \\nPigs are smarter than him even. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI never thought Brambles was a \\nGENIUS okay? \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\n(very obnoxious) \\n\\nMOM! The eggs are NOT DONE! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nFINE MAKE YOUR OWN FUCKING EGGS. \\n\\nMarion then throws the frying pan violently in the sink and \\nretreats to the bathroom. The noisy hair-dryer starts up. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nI WANTED TO YOU WONâT LET ME! \\n\\nLady Bird follows Marion out of the room. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nYour sister doesnât like me. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.)  \\n\\nMOM!!! IâM HUNGRY! \\n \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nShe does. \\n\\nShelly gets up, pouting. MIGUEL follows her \\n\\n \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\n\\nYOU HAD YOUR CHANCE! \\nGOING TO BED! \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLarry is left alone. Itâs weirdly peaceful for half a second. \\n\\nINT. 1994 TOYOTA COROLLA. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird and Larry on the way to school. She feverishly \\nchanges the radio station, finds a song she likes: \\n\\n14. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDid you know that Alanis Morisette \\nwrote this song in only ten \\nminutes? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nI believe it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(she smiles) \\n\\nSo Iâm applying to a couple East \\nCoast schools. I need you to help \\nme with the financial aid \\napplication but Mom canât know. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nWe... arenât they quite \\nexpensive? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nFirst, yes thatâs why financial \\naid. Second, I have to get in \\nfirst. \\n\\nMom wonât be happy about it. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhich is why I donât want to fight \\nabout it before I have to. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLady Bird looks up. They are a couple of blocks from school. \\n\\n15. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nJust pull over here \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nAre you sure, I can drive you to \\nthe front -- \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, just this is fine. I like to \\nwalk. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nOkay, well, I love you. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nSo what do you think? About \\ncollege? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nIâll see what I can do. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(kisses him on the cheek) \\nThanks Dad, love you too. Have a \\ngood day at work. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nHey, Iâm like Keith Richards âIâm \\njust happy to be anywhere.â \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(calling out) \\n\\nHey bitch! \\n\\nShe gets out quickly and hurries away. Sheâs almost at school \\nwhen Julie pulls up. \\n\\nMs. Pickett has VERY LARGE fake breasts. Her boyfriend, Matt, \\nhands a sack lunch to Lady Bird and Julie. \\n\\nMATT \\n\\nAlright girls, hope you like \\npickles. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLady Bird starts eating the Matt lunch and chucks her own \\nlunch into a garbage can. The one her Mom spent time making. \\n\\n16. \\n\\nMs. Pickett gets in the driverâs seat, they drive away. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nThanks, Uncle Matt. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nSweet! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHeâs not your uncle. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nItâs something Iâm trying out. \\nBye, mom. \\n \\n (watching Ms. Pickett go) \\n\\nYour Mom really likes you. \\n\\nJULIE \\nYeah. I just keep getting \\nfatter.  \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\n(mouth full) \\n\\nMe too. Matt is awesome. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYeah, I hope he marries my Mom. \\nThat would be nice. He promised me \\nhis old car when I turn eighteen. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThat car should be illegal. Jenna \\nWaltonâs not doing any off-roading. \\nShe just goes to Pavillions. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI heard Jenna Walton has a tanning \\nbed in her house. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nShe is so pretty. \\n \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nHer skin is luminous.  \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nMaybe we should try tanning. \\n\\nIn the student parking lot, a girl gets out of her fancy \\nRange Rover. Sheâs pretty in a high school way. \\n\\nThe girl, Jenna Walton, is very tan. Identical tan girls \\ndescend on her. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n17. \\n\\nINT. VESTMENT ROOM. DAY \\n\\nLady Bird and Julie sit with their legs up the wall, eating \\ncommunion wafers out of a large plastic container. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nYeah, in the tub I just scoot \\nmyself under like now, like this, \\nand then the water just... \\n\\nShe gestures, showing that the water would flow into her \\ncrotch and get her off. They are hysterically laughing. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWe are so gross! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI think I figured it out when I was \\nlike three or something. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI use, I take off the shower head, \\noh god this is so embarrassing! I \\nuse that. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI donât know if mine is the right \\nkind, though. Maybe itâs different \\nwhen you actually have a penis in \\nthere, like itâs more intense. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nMine is pretty intense, I think. \\n\\nDARLENE \\n\\nYouâre not supposed to eat the \\nwafers! \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(trying to be helpful) \\n\\nThey arenât consecrated. \\n\\nDarlene, an odd looking girl, has silently walked in. \\n\\nDarlene turns on her heel, annoyed. Lady Bird and Julie \\ndissolve into giggles. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird, wearing an extreme âauditionâ dress, and Julie, in \\nher uniform, sit and watch other students perform. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n18. \\n\\nFather Leviatch runs auditions - there is something funny and \\ndepressed about him. An overweight woman, Miss Patty, \\naccompanies on the piano when needed. \\n\\nA boy, Greg, is up. He has a big voice for such a tiny boy: \\n\\nGREG \\n\\nâBEING ALIVVEEEEEEEEEE......!â \\n\\nCut to Father Leviatch calling out from his clipboard: \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nOkay, Christine? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nLady Bird. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\nIs that your given name? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYes. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nWhy is it in quotes? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWell I gave it to myself. Itâs \\ngiven. To me, by me. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nOK, take it away, Lady Bird. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nâEverybody says donât / Everybody \\nsays donât / Everybody says donât \\nit isnât right, donât it isnât \\nniiiiiceeee / Everybody says donât \\n/ Everybody says donât / Everybody \\nsays donât walk on the grass....â \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(singing) \\n\\nâMake me a channel of your peace / \\nwhere thereâs despair in life let \\nme bring hope / where there is \\ndarkness only light / and where \\nthereâs sadness ever joy....â \\n\\nCut to Lady Bird singing her song. \\n\\nCut to Julie, wearing her uniform, shy and nervous: \\n\\nJulie has a sweet, clear, beautiful voice. Itâs a quiet \\nmoment and everyone pays attention. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMore girls and more boys. Now most everyone is done. \\n\\nDanny stands. Heâs very handsome. Strapping, even. He gives \\nhis sheet music to the Miss Patty. Then he sings: \\n\\n19. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\n(singing) \\n\\nâThere are giants in the sky! / \\nThere are big tall terrible giants \\nin the sky! When youâre way up \\nhigh and you look below at the \\nworld youâve left and the things \\nyou know little than a glance is \\nenough to show you just how small \\nyou are!â \\n\\nHeâs AMAZING. Julie and Lady Bird look at each other. DREAM \\nBOAT CITY. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRDâS ROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nUnderneath her window sill by her bed, Lady Bird writes the \\nname: \\n\\nDANNY. \\n\\nSheâs in love and want to make it permanent somewhere. \\nSuddenly, a voice is directed right at Lady Birdâs door: \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\nI CAN SEE THE LIGHT ON IN YOUR ROOM \\nGO TO BED! \\n\\nLady Bird shuts off her light and sleeps, dreaming of Danny. \\n\\nEXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. DAY \\n\\nLady Bird and Julie check the casting list. They first find: \\n\\nMERRILY WE ROLL ALONG \\n\\nFranklin Shepard: Danny OâNeill, Charlie Kringus: Greg Anrue \\n\\nGussie: Diana Greenway, Beth: Julie Steffans. \\n\\nThey move way down the list until they find: \\n\\nSwing/Chorus: Christine McPherson \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(tightly) \\nCongratulations. \\n\\nJULIE \\nYou too! We both got in! \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n20. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nEveryone who auditioned got in. The \\npart I got was basically not \\ngetting in. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(trying to downplay) \\n\\nI do not even know how I got cast \\nin my part. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMe neither. I was the one who had a \\ndress and prepared a song. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nI know! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(thinking) \\n\\nNow youâre going to get romantic \\nwith Danny on stage. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nItâs probably my only shot at that, \\nyou know? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMom... \\n\\nMARION \\n(re: the magazine) \\nWe donât need to buy that. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nItâs only three dollars. Iâm having \\na hard week. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIf you want to read it we can go to \\nthe public library. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI want to read it in bed. \\n\\n \\nShe take the pen and crosses out Christine and writes LADY \\nBIRD. Leaves. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nJulie stays and when sheâs sure sheâs alone she touches her \\nname - loving herself and the feeling of being chosen. \\n\\nINT. GROCERY STORE. EARLY EVENING. \\n\\nMarion grocery shops. Lady Bird looks at a BRIDE magazine. \\n\\n\\x0cMARION \\n\\nThatâs something rich people do. \\nWe are not rich people. \\n\\n21. \\n\\nLady Bird walks away and then tucks the magazine underneath \\nher sweater into the top of her skirt, sneakily stealing it. \\n\\nAs sheâs performing this maneuver, she sees DANNY (!) and his \\nMom and three little brothers walk by. She walks up bravely: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nHey! \\n\\nHi. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCome here often? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\n(not getting the joke) \\n\\nExcuse me? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(extending her hand) \\n\\nIâm Lady Bird, weâre going to be in \\nthe musical together. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nOh, yeah, I remember you! You were \\nwearing that dress. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI just wanted to say whatâs up and \\nIâll see you in rehearsal. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThanks, Iâm super excited. You live \\nin the neighborhood? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(doing a voice) \\n\\nNah, Iâm from the wrong side of the \\ntracks. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nWhat? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIs  that  your  family?  There  are  so \\nmany of you! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nIrish-Catholic! Itâs hard to find a \\ngirl to date thatâs not my cousin. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n22. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(flustered) \\n\\nWell, okay. Youâre going to make a \\ngreat Franklin. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThanks! I want my hair, his hair \\nto be curly, though. \\n\\nYeah! \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLike Jim Morrison. Very â70s. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nLike Jim Morrison exactly. \\n\\nDANNY! \\n\\nDANNYâS MOM \\n \\n\\nGotta go! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWho is Jim Morrison again? \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nHe was in a rock band, moron, The \\nDoors. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI knew that. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(looking at the bill) \\n\\nThis is with your employee \\ndiscount? \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nYeah, itâs already included. \\n\\nLady Bird walks back to Marion, who is with Miguel while he \\nscans their groceries and Shelly bags them. \\n\\nMarion looks worried. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON. \\n\\nEveryone tries to keep up with the dance steps Miss Patty \\nteaches them. She is also, apparently, the choreographer. She \\ncan move amazingly well for a bigger woman. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThey play theatre games and do acting exercises. Father \\nLeviatch is actually quite good at casting a spell and making \\neveryone feel included. \\n\\nThe priest, Father Leviatch, looks around the stage where \\neveryone sits, cross legged, tired from dancing. \\n\\n23. \\n\\nCUT TO: \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nTo get our emotions going, weâre \\ngoing to play âfirst one to cry \\nwins.â \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\nStarting ... Now. Iâm playing too. \\nSo is Miss Patty. \\n\\nMiss Patty nods. \\n\\nThey all try to cry really hard. Suddenly everyone looks up \\n- Father Leviatch is sobbing. \\n\\nEveryone is uncomfortable watching an adult man cry.  \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nIâm sorryâ¦ Iâm sorry. \\n\\nEXT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. AFTERNOON. \\n\\nDiana, another girl in the play, dishes the gossip while she \\nand Lady Bird and Danny wait for their rides: \\n\\nDIANA \\n\\nI heard that before he became a \\npriest he was married and he had a \\nson named Etienne who died of a \\ndrug overdose at 17 which was maybe \\na suicide but my mom says same \\ndifference if you are so careless \\nwith your life. \\n\\n(a horn honks) \\n\\nOh thatâs her! Gotta go, bye guys! \\n\\nLady Bird and Danny wave goodbye and then fall into a \\nsemi- awkward silence. She sees itâs her Moment. She tries \\nto casually hand Danny a bag but itâs a kind of big bag. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n24. \\n\\nHe pulls out the Conair pink and purple âHot Sticks.â \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, I almost forgot. I brought you \\nthese  hot  rollers.  For  your  Jim \\nMorrison hair. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThank you so much. \\n \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYouâre welcome.  \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nYouâll have to show me how to use \\nthem. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(weirdly formal) \\nIt would be my pleasure. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThey look like sperms. \\n\\nDANNY (CONTâD) \\n\\nHey! I just remembered I had a \\ndream about you! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nReally?! What happened? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nWe were flying to Disneyland on a \\ngiant carrot.... \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nAwesome! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nI love Disneyland. \\n\\nHe laughs and Lady Bird joins in. They do look like sperms \\nbut it wasnât so funny to say it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMe too, I think itâs kind of scary \\nbut I also love it. \\n\\nTriumph! They are having a Real Conversation. \\n\\nINT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY \\n\\nMr. Bruno explains a problem on a projector. Heâs handsome \\nand young-ish. Definitely handsome for an all girls school. \\nLady Bird zones out, thinking about Danny. Julie looks \\nintently at Mr. Bruno. She loves him, privately. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n25. \\n\\nJulie experience her mini moment of private embarrassment. \\nThey are handed back quizzes. Julie gets a A-. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\n(finishing an explanation) \\nDonât leave me hanging. Can I get \\na nod? Thatâs good. Maybe even a \\nverbal confirmation? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(too loud) \\n\\nYES. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nGood job, Jules, I could tell from \\nyour work that you even understood \\nthe one you missed! \\n\\nHe kind of winks at her. She blushes. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(looking at her grade) \\n\\nSUCK A DICK. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(to Lady Bird) \\n\\nI like âJules.â \\n\\nLady Bird looks at her C+. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI just donât get why Iâm not good \\nat math, my Dad is really good at \\nmath. Even Miguel has a math \\ndegree. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nMaybe itâs your Momâs fault. \\n\\nINT. HOMECOMING DANCE. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT. \\n\\nThere are a bunch of kids clumped, some dancing, some sitting \\non half-hearted hay bales. The popular girls, Jenna etc., \\nwear tank tops that say (front) Ditch the horse... (and back) \\nRide the cowboy! \\n\\nLady Bird and Julie now have on bandanas and denim - theyâre \\ndoing the Groucho Marx Duck Soup dance to âTha Crossroads.â \\nSuddenly Lady Bird stops. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYou lose! POINT JULIE! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, look\\n\\n\\x0cAcross the dance, there is Danny. Heâs wearing chaps, a holster, \\na hat, fake pistols. Like teenage John Wayne. \\n\\n26. \\n\\nJulie watches as Lady Bird makes a bee-line for Danny. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nWish me luck. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nLuck. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWanna dance? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nHell, yeah! \\n\\nThey start slow dancing together. Julie does the duck-soup \\ndance alone and then stops. Itâs pointless without a buddy. \\nShe falls back and watches. \\n\\nSister Sarah-Joan walks by Lady Bird and Danny: \\n\\nSISTER SARAH-JOAN \\n\\nSix inches for the Holy Spirit! \\n\\nThey roll their eyes: Rules! Once she leaves Danny pulls Lady \\nBird close again. She swoons. Life is happening. \\n\\nEXT. SCHOOL GYM. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird, Julie and Danny wait outside of the dance, leaning \\nagainst the gym waiting for their parents. Julieâs Mom pulls \\nup with Uncle Matt. Honks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(to Lady Bird) \\n\\nThatâs us! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNah, my Mom is coming. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nNo sheâs not. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(pointed) \\n\\nYes, she is. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nBut the plan was sleepover at - \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nITâS FINE. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n27. \\n\\nLady Bird is clearly trying to stay there with Danny. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(annoyed) \\n\\nOkay, bye then. \\n\\nJulie gets in the front seat to practice driving. Leaves. \\nLady Bird and Danny are quiet, listening to the muffled \\nsounds of the dance. Then: \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nHave you ever been out of the \\ncountry? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhen I was little, my Dad had a job \\nthat took him to Brazil. I remember \\nfrom the pictures. \\n\\nDANNY \\nIâve never been out of the \\ncountry. Itâs my dream to go \\nto Paris.  \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(sighs) \\n\\nParis. \\n\\nThatâs why Iâm learning French. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nMy mom said French wasnât useful. \\n\\nIt is if you want to go to Paris. \\n\\nDANNY (CONTâD) \\nI still donât know how to use those \\nrollers you gave me. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, itâs so easy, like after they \\nheat up, you just take your hair \\nand twist the hair and then twirl \\nthe thing like this... \\n\\nThey laugh. \\n\\nShe reaches up to his hair. He kisses her. Itâs surprising. \\nThey kiss again. Itâs romantic, really romantic. \\n\\nEXT. SACRAMENTO STREETS. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird walks home.

She sneaks past. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nLarry how long will this hold us. \\n\\nLARRY \\nI donât know... \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell, someone must know. Can the \\nwhole family go on Cobra, even \\nMiguel? What happens if someone \\ngets in an accident? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nIâm not sure - the severance \\npackage I think it expires all at \\nonce, not within the calendar \\nyear... \\n\\nMARION \\nIâll ask at my work if -- \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nIs she home? \\n\\nMaybe leave it for tonight... \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNo, she knows better. \\n(getting up) \\n\\nShe cannot sneak around like \\nthis... \\n\\nLady Bird tip-toes into her room. She knows she wasnât \\nsupposed to see this. And she doesnât want to know any more. \\n\\nSuddenly, a noise makes her turn her head sharply. \\n\\nMarion barrels down the hallway towards Lady Birdâs room. \\n\\nINT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady-Bird, under the covers, hears her Mom coming. Then all \\nthe lights come on, itâs so bright: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nChristine! You canât leave your \\nroom like this! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI didnât... \\n\\n\\x0c30. \\n\\nLady Bird sees her Dad pass by the door and give her a look \\nlike âIâm sorry, I canât help you here.â He disappears. \\nMarion picks up her uniform. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNone of these things were put \\naway right, they arenât nice, \\nCHRISTINE!

I donât \\nknow what your wealthy friends \\ndo... \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWhy do you care what I do to my \\nclothes? \\n\\nYour father does not have a job. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nHe lost his job, okay? Do you \\nneed him to come in here and \\nexplain that to you? \\n\\nMarion closes the door.. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30. \\n\\nMARION \\nOf course he wouldnât do it \\nanyway, heâs Mr. Nice Guy.

And \\nyou want to know the truth? Hereâs \\nthe truth: some of your friendsâ \\nfathers could employ your father \\nand they wonât do that if it looks \\nlike his family is trash. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(quietly) \\n\\nDidnât you ever go to sleep without \\nputting all your clothes away \\nperfectly? Like even once? And \\ndonât you wish your Mom hadnât \\ngotten angry? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nMy mother was an abusive alcoholic. \\n\\nLady Bird puts all her clothes away while Marion watches. \\n\\nLady Bird has nothing to say to this, Marion wins. \\n\\nINT.

Lady Bird lazily walks the halls. \\n\\nShe sees her empty math classroom and sees that Mr. Bruno \\nisnât there. She ducks inside. Notices his grade binder on \\nthe desk. Snatches it and then runs. \\n\\nShe dumps it into one of the big trash cans and hurries away. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nINT. THRIFT TOWN. DAY. \\n\\nMarion and Lady Bird are looking through dresses. \\n\\n35. \\n\\nLady Bird finds something - holds up a black dress. \\n\\nMARION \\nDid Danny say whether his \\ngrandmother has a formal \\nThanksgiving? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI donât know, there are a lot of \\nkids, but she lives in the fab \\nforties... \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(nodding) \\n\\nYour dad and I went to a dinner \\nparty once in that neighborhood, \\nthe CEO of ISC, and it was pretty \\nformal. \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nYouâre not going to a funeral. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWell, I donât know! What says ârich \\npeople Thanksgivingâ? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nItâs just such a shame that youâre \\nspending your last Thanksgiving \\nwith a family youâve never met \\ninstead of us, but I guess you want \\nit that way. \\n\\n(clocks her walking) \\n\\nAre you tired? \\n\\nThey keep looking. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo. \\n\\nA saleswoman, Joyce, calls out: \\n\\nJOYCE SALESWOMAN \\n\\nHey Marion! \\n\\nMarion waves to the saleswoman. Her voice is so warm and \\nfriendly with other people who are not her daughter: \\n\\nMARION \\nHey Joyce! Howâs the baby! \\n\\n\\x0c36. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nJOYCE SALESWOMAN \\n\\nHeâs crawling! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOoohhh, I want to see a picture at \\ncheckout! \\n\\n(back to Lady Bird) \\n\\nIf youâre tired we can sit down. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIâm not tired! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nOh itâs just that I couldnât tell \\nbecause youâre dragging your feet. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(silence) \\n\\nMARION \\nWell, I just couldnât tell. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nWhy didnât you just say âPick up \\nyour feet.â \\n\\nI didnât know if you were tired. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou were being passive aggressive! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNo. I wasnât. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYou are so INFURIATING. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nPlease stop yelling. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nIâm not yelling. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nOh itâs perfect! \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nDonât you love it.  \\n\\nMarion sees something. Holds it up. Itâs a beautiful old \\nfashioned looking dress. Marion has found the needle in the \\nhaystack. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n37. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRDâS HOUSE. LATE AT NIGHT. \\n\\nMarion, still in her nurses uniform, sits at the sewing \\nmachine, tailoring the dress she and Lady Bird found. She \\nfinishes, and then hangs it up quietly in Lady Birdâs room. \\nDoesnât wake her up, simply watches her daughter sleep for a \\nminute. \\n\\nINT. ALGEBRA II CLASS. DAY. \\n\\nMr. Bruno addresses his class: \\n\\nThey are going up one by one to talk through their grade and \\nhe can start again. \\n\\nMR. Bruno \\n\\nSo because my gradebook has \\ndisappeared, I am going to count on \\nyou to reconstruct it. I know you \\nall know your grades better than \\nanybody. I have a general idea, but \\nthis is all about the honor code \\nright now, okay? \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nA- \\n\\nMR. Bruno \\nIâm pretty sure it was an A. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nUm, Iâm not but okay... \\n\\nMR. Bruno \\n\\nIt was â trust me, I know talent \\nwhen I see it. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nYouâre welcome. No, thank you. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHey, I think B. \\n\\nMR. Bruno \\n\\nI thought it was more like B- maybe \\neven C+ territory. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo, because I did really well on \\nthe last quiz... \\n\\nHe does that wink thing at her again. She retreats, red \\nfaced. Lady Bird is next: \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n38. \\n\\nMR. Bruno \\n\\nI seem to remember you doing only \\nslightly better. \\n\\nIt brought my average up to a B. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMR. Bruno \\n\\nOkay, B it is. Itâs your honor. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRDâS HOUSE. DAY. \\n\\nMarion, Larry, Shelly and Miguel run around making sure the \\nhouse is perfect for their Thanksgiving. The doorbell rings. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nLADY BIRD! YOUR LOVER AWAITS! \\n\\nMarion opens the door, lets in Danny. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nHello, Danny! The famous Danny! \\nArenât you adorable! \\n(she  hugs  him) \\nLarry isnât he adorable? \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\nHeâs adorable. \\n\\nMARION \\nAnd youâre driving her and \\neverything - Wow! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nThank you for letting Lady Bird \\ncome to my Grandmotherâs \\nThanksgiving, Mrs. McPherson. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nNo more politeness, just call me \\nMarion! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\n(firmly shaking Larryâs \\n\\nhand) \\n\\nNice to meet you, Mr. McPherson. \\n\\nLARRY \\nPlease, call me Mr. Larry \\nMcPherson.\\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n39. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(hits him)  \\n\\nLarry! Sit down Danny, can I get \\nyou something to drink? \\n\\n \\n\\n  DANNY \\n\\nOh no, Iâm fine.  \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\n(waving) \\n\\nHi, Iâm Miguel. The brother. \\nI think Lady Bird wants to make an \\nentrance. Sheâs mad we donât have a \\nspiral staircase. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\n(quietly) \\n\\nShelly. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nWhat? \\n \\n\\nIs my name. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nItâs funny, on my way here, I went \\nover the train tracks -- \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nYou took H street? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nRight, and so just Lady Bird always \\nsays that she lives on the wrong \\nside of the tracks, but I always \\nthought that it was, like, a \\nmetaphor. \\n\\nAh. \\n \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nTheyâre quiet for a moment. Danny tries to converse: \\n\\nBut there are actual train tracks. \\n\\nMarionâs face contorts. This is painful. \\n\\nJust then, Lady Bird enters, looking beautiful in her vintage \\ndress. She holds a duffel bag. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(now upset with her) \\n\\nWhat in the hell is in that duffel \\nbag? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n40. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDonât worry about it, Jeez! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nMy grandmother will love that \\ndress. \\n\\nINT. DANNYâS GRANDMOTHERâS HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON. \\n\\nThanksgiving. It is at the Dream House. From the beginning. \\nThe blue one with the white trim and the American Flag. Lady \\nBird cannot believe it. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWait, this is your grandmaâs \\nhouse? Oh my god.  \\n\\nShe meets his Grandmother, almost kisses her hand like sheâs \\na queen but pulls back just in time: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYour house is my favorite in all \\nof East Sacramento.  \\n\\n \\n \\nLady Bird and Danny walk through the house. She spots very \\nprominent Ronald Regan poster: \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nIs this... a joke? \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nNo. \\n\\nLady Bird meets people, so many people, and in a lull, folds \\na napkin in a cool way - it looks like a four-pointed flower. \\nDannyâs Grandmother notices, and IS TOTALLY INTO IT. Soon, \\nLady Bird is folding all the napkins at the tables this way, \\nteaches her how to do it, too. It is clear how much Dannyâs \\nGrandmother enjoys Lady Bird. \\n\\nINT. DANNYâS CAR. NIGHT \\n\\nLady Bird and Danny are singing along with songs from the \\nshow. Pick up Julie from her apartment complex. Pick up Greg \\nfrom his house. Now theyâre all singing. \\n\\nIn the car, they change out of their Thanksgiving âfineryâ \\nand put on what they consider to be âpeople who listen to \\nmusic in coffee shopâ outfits. That was what the duffel was \\nfor, the costume change. There are scarves and a beret. \\n\\nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT. \\n\\nIn their new outfits, Greg and Danny and Julie and Lady Bird \\nsmoke a out of a bowl, which another one of them lights. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHow do you know when itâs working? \\n\\n41. \\n\\n\\x0c42. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nItâs not? My sister said this was \\npremium. \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nYouâll know. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nItâs not working. \\n\\nGREG \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nIâm working. \\n\\nIâm working too. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNope. \\n\\nThey are quiet for a second. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nI canât feel my arms. \\n\\nGREG \\n\\nYouâre working. \\n\\nThey laugh really hard. Danny makes out with Lady Bird.  \\n\\nINT. NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. NIGHT. \\n \\nThey hazily take stock of everything. There are some ironic \\nturkeys pinned up on the stage. \\n\\nThe âcool kidsâ are there. They donât say hi but they donât \\nshun them. Jenna Walton is there with her boyfriend, Jonah \\nRuiz. Heâs singing pretty terrible songs about her with his \\nband, the pretentiously named Lâenfance Nue. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n(whispered to Julie) \\n\\nIf Danny and I get married and then \\nhis Grandma died, Iâd inherit the \\nDream House. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWouldnât his parentâs get it? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(realizing) \\n\\nOh yeah, weâd have to kill them. \\nAnd kill his older brothers, too. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n43. \\n\\nKyle Scheible, a long-haired beautiful bassist, is really \\ninto it. Lady Bird spends an extra-long time looking at this \\nKyle Scheible. She feels DEEPLY ATTRACTED to him. She looks \\nat Danny, she loves him, yes, but there is something else \\ngoing on with Kyle Scheible. Sheâs not sure, maybe itâs the \\npot. Maybe not. REMEMBER KYLE, Lady Bird will. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Bruno is there - weird. He looks at Julie, who \\nwas looking at him. She turns quickly away. \\n\\nJULIE \\n(to no one) \\n\\nWhere is Mr. Brunoâs wife...? \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRDâS HOUSE. NIGHT. \\n\\nLady Bird and Danny stand by the microwave, making âSmart \\nOnesâ frozen dinners. Six of them. Greg and Julie also eat, \\neveryone with their own spoon taking bites out of the \\ndifferent platters. \\n\\nThen Marion walks in - they are still giggling, she awkwardly \\nannounces herself: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nHowâs it going? \\n\\nNo one can say anything, itâs almost like theyâre frozen. \\nFinally Lady Bird is able to squeak out: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMom, we really canât talk right now. \\n\\nThey all dissolve into giggles again. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWell, Happy Thanksgiving. We missed \\nyou, Lady Bird. \\n\\nMarion leaves. Sheâs hurt and angry but mostly hurt. \\n\\nEXT. LADY BIRDâS FRONT YARD. NIGHT \\n\\nThe kids all pile back into Dannyâs car. Lady Bird waves \\ngoodbye, all of them laughing. Then they are gone. Lady Bird \\nshivers a little, now alone. Startles when she sees Shelly \\nsmoking: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n (curious) \\n\\nWhy does that cigarette look so \\nweird? Like not like cigarette? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nShelly offers her a drag. Lady Bird drags and coughs. \\n\\n44. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nItâs a clove. Lick your lips. \\nThatâs why theyâre sweet. \\n\\n(then) \\n\\nYour Mom was really sad you werenât \\nhere tonight for Thanksgiving. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\nWell, she hates me. \\n\\nSHELLY \\n\\nShe has a big heart, your Mom. She \\ntook me in after my parents freaked \\nout about, whatever, pre-marital \\nsex. I admire her. \\n\\nLady Bird doesnât fight Shelly. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER. GIRLS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. ` \\n\\nBuzzing in the girls dressing room. Itâs opening night! \\n\\nThey are putting up pictures and do-dads. They are exchanging \\nâopening nightâ gifts. The girls are applying too much \\nmakeup. There is music playing and lots of screaming. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER. BOYS DRESSING ROOM. EARLY EVENING. \\n\\nThe boys also get ready. They are putting on powder and \\ncombing their hair. Itâs less loud, but also kinetic. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. EARLY \\nEVENING. \\n\\nAll the boys and girls are gathered in a circle. Father \\nLeviatch and Miss Patty are leading the prayer. \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\n\\nSAINT IGNATIUS OF LOYOLA... \\n\\nEVERYONE \\n\\n(shouts) \\nPRAY FOR US! \\n\\nDANNY \\n\\nLIVE JESUS IN OUR HEARTS... \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n45. \\n\\nEVERYONE \\n\\nFOREVER! \\n\\nThey break and cheer. Itâs time for the show. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. \\n\\nThe show is about to begin. The audience sits in the dark. \\nThe students in the wings. The paltry orchestra strikes up \\nthe first chord. \\n\\nMERRILY WE ROLL ALONG is actually a pretty upsetting and \\nadult show. Julie sings a song about divorce. The other \\nâfabulousâ girl, Diana, plays a character who has an affair. \\nThereâs lots of pretend drinking of alcohol. They dance and \\nsing their hearts out \\n\\nEveryone cheers at the end, but more about the fact of the \\nshow as opposed to the show itself. \\n\\nThe audience includes the whole of Lady Birdâs family, \\nJulieâs Mom and Uncle Matt, Dannyâs whole Irish-Catholic \\nclan. Everyone is proud. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. \\n\\nMingling after the show. Some of the administrators look \\nscandalized. \\n\\nJulie sees Mr. Bruno and approaches him, feeling beautiful \\nand confident: \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nThere she is! Jules, wow! You were \\nso good. I couldnât believe that. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nThank you... \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\nJules, Iâd like you to meet my \\nwife, Becky. Becky this is Jules, \\none of my brightest students. \\n\\nBECKY \\n\\nNice to meet you. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(devastated) \\n\\nNice to meet you, too. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nHow we doing? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n46. \\n\\nBECKY \\nYeah, Iâm a little tired. \\n\\nMR. BRUNO \\n\\nOkay, I gotta get her home, weâve \\ngot the little one, but great \\nwork Jules. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\n(as they leave) \\n\\nCongratulations. \\n\\nJulie is humiliated, and doesnât quite know why. She sits \\ndown next to Father Leviatch, who also looks traumatized. He \\nwatches people pass him by: \\n\\nFATHER LEVIATCH \\nThey didnât understand it \\n\\nINT. DINER. NIGHT. \\n\\nThe entire cast and crew is there, enjoying their opening \\nnight, eating a lot of chicken fingers and french fries. They \\nare being silly and playing a Broadway trivia game. Lady Bird \\nand Danny make towers with the sugar packets. Julie and Greg \\nhang out together: theyâre both the âextraâ friends. Everyone \\nis giddy and happy. \\n\\nINT. DINER GIRLS BATHROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nJulie and Lady Bird wait for the stalls to open up. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU ALL WILL \\nBE I DRANK SO MUCH SODA! \\n\\nSTALL WOMAN (O.S.) \\n\\nFuck you. \\n\\nCHORUS MEMBER (O.S.) \\n\\nI just got my period! \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nGoddamn it! \\n\\nLady Bird leaves. \\n\\n \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nWhere are you going? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n47. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThereâs never a line in the menâs \\nroom! \\n\\nINT.

JULIEâS HOUSE. NIGHT. \\n\\nThey both cry. They listen to âCrash Into Meâ by Dave \\nMatthews and sob. \\n\\nThe song ends and Lady Bird starts it over. \\n\\nINT. XAVIER MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM/THEATRE. NIGHT. \\n\\nThey perform the next night. \\n\\nNo fun. Itâs no fun because their boyfriends are gay. \\n\\nINT. DOCTORâS OFFICE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird gets her cast off with a saw. Marion watches. \\n\\nThe doctor throws the cast in the trash. She is mournful. \\n\\nINT. ST. FRANCIS. DAY. \\n\\nFinals.

Even Shelly. \\n\\nMARION \\nTheyâre really nice socks. \\n\\nTheyâre expensive, actually.

We \\nwanted to, well, itâs just a little \\nsmall this year. \\n\\nLarry opens his gift. \\n\\n(laughing) \\n\\nItâs just what I needed, honey. \\n\\nHe holds up a throw pillow that says âGolfers Donât Diet They \\nJust Exist On Greens.â He laughs. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n(laughing, too) \\n\\nIt makes me laugh. \\n\\nINT. LADY BIRDâS ROOM. NIGHT. \\n\\nA gentle knock on the door. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) \\n\\nDad? Come in. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\n(entering) \\n\\nHow did you know it was me? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMom doesnât knock. \\n\\nLARRY \\n\\n(laughs) \\nNo, she doesnât. \\n\\nHe gives her an envelope. Quietly says: \\n\\nLARRY (CONTâD) \\n\\nHere they are, your completed \\nfinancial aid applications. Merry \\nChristmas. \\n\\nLady Bird throws her arms around Larry. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nThank you! Thank you! \\n\\nLARRY \\nDo you need money for the \\napplications? Because I can help \\nwith that, too, I just need to -- \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n49. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n-- no, no, Iâve got that, summer \\njobs covered it. \\n\\nINT. FAMILY/COMPUTER/MIGUELâS ROOM. COMPUTER. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird frantically fills out her applications: addresses \\nthings, puts materials in envelopes. \\n\\nHe indicates Shelly, looking forlorn by the pullout sofa-bed. \\n\\nMIGUEL \\n\\nThis is why we have computer shut- \\noff time - this is our room. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOkay, okay, just can you drive me \\nto the post office on J?

NEW HELVETIA COFFEE SHOP. AFTERNOON. \\n\\nThis is where she got high the first time and the band played \\n- now Lady Bird learns the cash-register, espresso machine, \\nand then sees Kyle Scheible, that amazing looking bassist, \\nsitting at a table outside, plowing through âThe Peopleâs \\nHistory of the United States.â \\n\\nLater, he steps outside to smoke, she notices and follows: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nHey! I like your band with Jonah \\nRuiz, L\\'enfance Nue? \\n\\n(she pronounces it \\n\\nLenfance New) \\n\\nKYLE \\n(correcting her \\npronunciation) \\n\\nLâenfance Nue. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nI saw your Thanksgiving show. My \\nnameâs Lady Bird. \\n\\n\\x0cThey shake hands. There is something instantly sexual between \\nthem. Lady Bird has never felt this thing before.

Her eyes rest on Jenna - she wants Kyle as her \\nboyfriend and Jenna as her friend. She wants to be part of \\nthis thing, this popular-straight-kid thing sheâs always been \\noutside of. \\n\\nLady Bird takes her blessing, arms crossed. \\n\\nINT. HOMEROOM. DAY. \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nThe first time we did it was at his \\nlake house last summer. It was so \\nfunny... \\n\\nJulie hands Lady Bird a sack lunch: \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nFrom Uncle Matt. I think he and my \\nMom are fighting, so enjoy these \\nlunches while you can. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, no thanks, Iâm trying to lose \\nweight. \\n\\nJULIE \\n\\nReally? \\n\\nBut Lady Bird isnât paying attention. Sheâs angling towards \\nJenna Walton, the tan, who holds court: \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nYeah, sex is not a big deal, itâs \\njust my mom called during it! \\n\\nEveryone laughs. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nEveryone else laughs again. Julie now tries to join in: \\n\\n51. \\n\\nJENNA (CONTâD) \\nIt was on my cell phone, she got it \\nfor emergencies. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nDid you pick up? \\n\\nJENNA \\n\\nYeah, I was like, \"um, Mom, I ca not \\nreally talk right now.\" \\n\\nWhat?

It was the right \\nthing to do. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(whispering) \\n\\nLet me guess she didnât get it. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nAnd she was sitting there waiting \\nfor the doctor to come in and \\nsomething deep inside her said NO. \\n\\nBingo. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nAnyone want to guess who this woman \\nis? \\n\\nHands shoot up. \\n\\nCASEY (CONTâD) \\n\\nThe young lady right here. \\n\\nYOUNG LADY \\n\\nYou? \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n71. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nNo, it was not me. \\n\\nANOTHER YOUNG LADY \\n\\nUm, your friend? \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nNo, the girl in the story was... my \\nmother. \\n\\nGasps from the audience. \\n\\nCASEY (CONTâD) \\nI am that baby that she decided not \\nto abort.  \\n\\nCut to: Laminated graphics about abortion are being passed \\naround. \\n\\nUnfortunately this comment was loud enough for Casey to hear. \\n\\nCASEY (CONTâD) \\nThat could have been me, that could \\nhave been my fate. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(to Jenna) \\n\\nJust because something looks ugly \\ndoesnât mean that it is morally \\nwrong. \\n\\nCASEY \\nWhat did you say, maâam? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNothing. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nPlease share. \\n\\nLady Bird looks at Jenna and decides that sheâs really going \\nto impress her: \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(loud) \\n\\nI said âJust because something \\nlooks ugly doesnât mean that it is \\nmorally wrong.â \\n\\nThe girls are shocked and embarrassed, but laughing too. \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n72. \\n\\nCASEY \\n\\nYou think dead children arenât \\nmorally wrong? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nNo... \\n\\nSheâs going all in: \\n\\nLADY BIRD (CONTâD) \\n\\nIâm just saying that if you took up \\nclose pictures of my vagina while I \\nwas on my period it would be \\ndisturbing but it doesnât make it \\nwrong. \\n\\nGASPS! Sister Sarah-Joan clocks Lady Birdâs escalating mania. \\nShe briefly makes eye-contact with her. Lady-Bird is ashamed, \\nbut uses her shame to plow ahead rather than turn back. \\n\\nCASEY \\n(horrified) \\n\\nExcuse me? What did you say? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nListen, if your mother had had the \\nabortion we would not have to sit \\nthrough this stupid assembly? \\n\\nMARION (O.S.) \\nSuspended?!

Gets it on somehow. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nYouâre so dextrous with that... Oh! \\n\\nTheyâre sort of having sex now. Sheâs still on top. It goes \\non for a little bit.

Youâre going to have so much \\nun-special sex in your life. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(fully angry now) \\n\\nI was on top! Who the fuck is on \\ntop their first time! \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nDo you have any awareness about \\nhow many civilians weâve killed \\nsince invasion in Iraq started? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nSHUT UP.

Itâs not all war. \\n \\n\\nKyle moves away and opens a book. \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\n(worried) \\n\\nAre we still going to prom \\ntogether? \\n\\nKYLE \\n\\nSure. \\n\\nKyle has been reading something out of the corner of his eye. \\n\\nINT. KITCHEN. KYLEâS HOUSE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird sneaks down the stairs, still crying, trying to get \\naway without a conversation. Through a door, she sees Kyleâs \\nDad. Heâs very thin and wears lots of sweaters, obviously \\nsick. He drinks a cup of tea. \\n\\nEXT. KYLEâS HOUSE. DAY. \\n\\nLady Bird waits outside, sitting on the curb.

Marion pulls over, hugs \\nher: \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nIt was easier. \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nHey, itâs okay, itâs okay. \\n\\nAs sheâs rubbing her back, Marion takes in Lady Birdâs shirt, \\nshe doesnât recognize it. \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nWhat is this sweater? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nOh, itâs just, my friend Jenna gave \\nit to me. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nWhoâs Jenna? \\n\\nLADY BIRD \\n\\nMy friend. \\n\\nMarion doesnât know her daughterâs friends, her t-shirts, or \\nwhy sheâs crying. She holds Lady Bird, then thinks of \\nsomething: \\n\\nMARION \\n\\n... want to do our favorite Sunday \\nactivity? I donât have a second \\nshift... \\n\\nLady Bird nods, it would be nice. \\n\\nINT./EXT. OPEN HOUSES AROUND SACRAMENTO. DAY. \\n\\nMarion and Lady Bird go to all the different open houses. \\nThey love doing this.

Her Mom \\njust crushed something that she liked and was very âher.â \\nMarion picks up that sheâs upset: \\n\\nMARION (CONTâD) \\n\\nWhat? \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) \\n\\nWhy canât you say I look nice? \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nI thought you didnât even care \\nwhat I think. \\n\\nLADY BIRD (O.S.) \\n\\nI still want you to think I look \\ngood. \\n\\nMARION \\n\\nIâm sorry, I was telling you the \\ntruth.
