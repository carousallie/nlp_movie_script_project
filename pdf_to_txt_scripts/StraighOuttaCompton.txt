Emblazoned across the black screen is: DETROIT MICHIGAN.
August 1989.
FADE IN:
EXT. JOE LOUIS STADIUM - DETROIT - NIGHT
Queues of youthful CONCERTGOERS are frisked by COPS as they
present their tickets and move through some turnstiles into
the stadium area.
We move upward until we land on a MARQUIS that says APPEARING
TONIGHT: NWA.
INT. JOE LOUIS STADIUM - NIGHT
It's a packed house. Swarms of TEENAGERS from the floor to
the cheap seats wait in rabid anticipation for the performers
to take the stage. Small fights, like brush fires, break
out here and there. We come to rest on a TEENAGER holding a
sign above his head. It says "Fuck Tha Police."
Closer to the stage, two large flanks of DETROIT COPS emerge
from either side and form an imposing WALL, cutting off the
view of the patrons in front. Their movements seem almost
machine-like as they move in lockstep with one another, a
grim determination on their faces. They stare at the minimal
stage dressing: TWO MIXING BOOTHS with turntables and some
MICROPHONES.
INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - NIGHT
HOLD on a pair of black canvas HIGHTOPS. There's a slight
bulge near the ankle of one of the pants legs. We angle up
from the sneakers to see EAZY E towering above us. Eazy's
5'5" frame belies his larger than life personality. He has
the barrel chest of a much larger man and his thoughts are
strategically concealed behind dark sunglasses that add a
touch of menace.
Eazy hangs up the receiver of a PAY PHONE and sees a WHITE
COP with a big, beefy face walking menacingly toward him.
As the Cop approaches him, Eazy pulls a PISTOL from the front
of his pants and places it, handle out, in the palm of the
Cop's hand.
EAZY
Save you the trouble.

No clip.

The Cop takes the gun and inspects it. The clip has been
removed. He stares very intently at Eazy then continues
down the hallway.

2.
Eazy watches as the Cop disappears into a room to his right
and then pulls out ANOTHER GUN from the back of his pants.
Next, he pulls a clip from the bulge in his sock, pops it in
the handle, shoves the GUN into the front of his pants.
When the coast is clear, he turns and then walks down the
hallway.
EAZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Nobody ever did shit in life without
representing something. And I suppose
up until that night, we'd just been
making it up as we went along.
INT. BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Eazy stops at the edge of the door and observes four black
men as they are vigorously patted down by FOUR COPS. Each
man wears BLACK JEANS and a BLACK T-SHIRT. Three other COPS,
including the Cop that Eazy just gave his gun to, observe
the process.
Moving left to right we begin on 20-year-old ICE CUBE; he's
stocky, cocky and alert. He forces a grim smile even though
he's burning inside. Continue over to DR. DRE, 24. He's
the tallest and best-looking of the group. The pat-down is
no big deal for him. Just another day at the office. Next
up is DJ YELLA, 22. The slightest of the group, he smiles
widely. Continuing right, we come upon on MC REN, 24. He's
ramrod stoic. His face suggests more history and less hope
than his boys. It takes all his willpower not to fight back.
We're back on Eazy, poker face in tact.
The Cops depart the room, passing Eazy on their way out.
Cube, Dre, Yella and Ren all turn to face Eazy. Suddenly,
Eazy pulls the GUN from his pants and waves them forward.
They all break into smiles.
EAZY
We're not gonna do it.
Fuck that.

CUBE
We gotta do it.

EAZY
If we do it, we're not gonna get
paid.
DRE
Then forget it.

It's not worth it

Eazy surveys the faces of his crew who appear to have mixed
feelings.

It's settled then.

INT. JOE LOUIS STADIUM - STAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS
Teenagers of all ethnicities continue to buck up against the
wall of cops near the stage. Sweaty bodies are packed against
one another. Hands and fists are raised to the sky. Lighters
are ignited. Tension and anticipation remain high.
We come back to the young teenager holding the sign.
YOUNG TEENAGER
Fuck tha Police!
The young teenager is quickly apprehended by TWO COPS and
dragged from the scene.
INT. JOE LOUIS STADIUM - BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
The five band members move down a narrow corridor toward the
stage. They pass a series of COPS who are stationed like
signposts about every twenty feet.
EAZY (V.O.)
Our music was about life as we saw
it and life as we lived it.
The group members round a corner and glimpse the stage area
for the first time. Tension and anticipation abound.
EAZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I'd never seen more security for a
show my whole life.
The group members stop just short of the stage. All four of
them are in full frame as they stare out at the screaming
crowd.
INT. JOE LOUIS STADIUM - CONTINUOUS
The stadium goes BLACK and HYSTERICAL CHEERS fill the void.
STADIUM ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
From Compton, California please
welcome the world's most dangerous
group! N-W-A!
The crowd is on fire as Eazy, Dre, Yella, Ren and Cube take
to the front of the stage and strike aggressive poses at the
swarm of Cops positioned in front of them.
Cube, Dre, Ren and Yella all look at Eazy, who is in a stare
down with the cops.

4.
Eazy looks out at the cheering audience, then over to the
angry policemen who are gathering off stage. His expression
changes slightly, subtly indicating that he has changed his
mind about singing "Fuck Tha Police."
Eazy turns and gives each of the other guys a nod. Defiant
grins suddenly wash across their faces, indicating that they
understand and endorse the change. Yella takes his spot in
one of the DJ booths. As a ferocious beat starts, Dr. Dre
grabs a mike.
DRE
Right now, NWA court is in full
effect. Judge Dre presiding the
case of NWA versus the police
department. Prosecuting attorneys
are MC Ren, Ice Cube, DJ Yella and
Eazy muthafuckin E. Order, order,
order! Ice Cube, take the muthafuckin
stand! Do you swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothin'
but the truth so help your black
ass?
CUBE
You're goddamn right!
DRE
Why don't you tell everybody what
the fuck you got to say?
Sneering at the crowd, Cube grabs the mike and breaks into
NWA's anthem "Fuck tha Police."
CUBE
Fuck tha police, coming straight
from the underground, A young nigga
got it bad cause I'm brown, And not
the other color so police think,
they have the authority to kill a
minority, Fuck that shit, cause I
ain't the one, For a punk muthafucka
with a badge and a gun...
The crowd is going wild. The POLICE OFFICERS hired as
security in the front of the stage look like bulls ready to
explode from their gates and onto the stage. Eazy locks
eyes with the icy stare of a COP standing directly in front
of him in the audience.
SLOW MOTION
Suddenly the HOUSE LIGHTS come up. A frenzy of confusion
spins around Eazy as the policemen swarm the stage and stop
the show.

5.
Eazy sees two cops shove Ice Cube face down on the floor.
Eazy grabs the pistol from his waistband and tosses it to
the back of the stage. The pistol sails through the air...
EXT.

COMPTON ALLEY - 1979 - DAY

We follow the flight of a PISTOL as it lands in a PIZZA BOX
inside a dumpster. A BLACK MAN has just dumped the pistol
and is sprinting down the alley, out of breath. A POLICE
SIREN wails in the distance.
It's a decade earlier. A young Eazy E is standing in the
open BACK DOOR of a COCO'S RESTAURANT, wearing a dirty apron
and holding a bus tray piled high with dirty dishes. He saw
the black man toss the gun and his eyes are on that dumpster.
EAZY (V.O.)
A lot of people say different things
about the ghetto. Think it's bad or
something. But I never saw it that
way. I loved Compton. For me, all
I saw was opportunity.
Suddenly a PATROL CAR screeches into the alley, blocking the
man's escape route. Eazy steps back into a doorway and peers
out as two COPS leap from their car with their guns drawn.
Freeze!

COP 1
Hit the dirt asshole!

The man spins around and sees another PATROL CAR pull up
behind him. He's boxed in.
COP 2
Put your hands on your head and lie
down on the ground now!
The man puts his hands behind his head, drops to his knees
and lies down. All four cops close in on him, their batons
drawn. Eazy watches as the police brutally beat the man,
before cuffing him and dragging him to a patrol car.
As soon as the patrol car pulls away, Eazy walks over to the
DUMPSTER and looks inside. He sees the pistol lying on the
pizza box. Eazy grabs it, opens the chamber and inspects
it.
INT.

COMPTON PAWN SHOP -

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Eazy stands in front of the shop's streetwise black
PROPRIETOR. The proprietor checks the gun, impressed. Then
he walks to the WINDOW and pulls down the SHADE to give them
some privacy.

6.
PROPRIETOR
This is a nice gun. Where'd you get
it, little man?
EAZY
It was my Aunt's. She lived in a
rough neighborhood but she moved.
So she don't need it no more.
PROPRIETOR
And who stripped off the serial
number? I suppose that was your
uncle?
The proprietor chuckles at Eazy's self-confidence, then slides
two twenty-dollar bills over to him. Eazy has to stand on
his toes to see over the cash register. He eyes the two
bills.
EAZY
I can get 75 bucks for this same gun
over at Jackie's Second Hand Store.
Eazy picks up the pistol and heads for the door.
Alright.

PROPRIETOR
I'll give you 80.

Eazy turns around with a smile and walks back. The proprietor
shakes his head, chuckles and hands Eazy the money.
PROPRIETOR (CONT'D)
Ya know, for a three-foot nigga you
got six feet of attitude.

DOWNTOWN COMPTON STREET - CONTINUOUS

Eazy steps out of the pawnshop counting his cash.
across the street catches his eye.

Something

EAZY (V.O.)
It wasn't a problem picking up a
buck here and there. But I had big
dreams and so did my friend, Andre.
ACROSS THE STREET
15-year-old ANDRE YOUNG is stepping into a record store.
Eazy runs across the street and follows him in.
INT.

COMPTON RECORD STORE - CONTINUOUS

Eazy walks over to Andre who's flipping through some records
in a stack.

7.
EAZY
Ain't you supposed to be in school,
nigga?
ANDRE
Look who's talking.
Andre pulls a record out of a stack.
ANDRE (CONT'D)
Hey, Eazy, they got the Bootsy Collins
album I been looking for. "Player
of the Year." I need this for that
mix I'm working out. Can you float
me five? I'm a little tight.
Eazy shakes his head with a wry grin and hands Andre one of
the twenties. Andre smiles and heads for the cashier.
EAZY (V.O.)
Andre had a gift for music. He had
the biggest record collection in the
'hood and he could mix on two
turntables like no one I ever seen.
But the boy was always broke.
Andre pays for the record and as he and Eazy leave the store
they playfully engage in a tug-o-war with the change from
the twenty.
EAZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Our first big idea was to set up
dance parties wherever we could find
a space. 'Course we needed some
equipment.
EXT.

COMPTON NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Eazy is in the BACKYARD of someone's house. He's stacking
some cinder blocks on top of one another underneath a window,
then he climbs up and peers in.
EAZY'S POV
Inside the house is a major STEREO SYSTEM. Speakers,
turntables and tape decks. This is clearly someone's pride
and joy. Eazy eyes the system hungrily.
INT. ABANDONED COMPTON WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
The equipment from the house is now set up on a SMALL STAGE.
Andre is mixing records with his friend D.J. YELLA standing
next to him wearing headphones and bopping to the beat.
Swarms of black teenagers dance and mill about in front of
them.

8.
A banner that says "High Powered Productions" is draped on
the wall behind them.
EAZY (V.O.)
Andre was a master at knowing what
people wanted to hear. He started
calling himself Dr. Dre and he his
buddy D.J. Yella really knew how to
mix it up. For two brothers from
the 'hood they weren't doing too
bad. They just needed me to show
'em how to capitalize on their talent.
AT THE WAREHOUSE ENTRANCE
Eazy is at the door, collecting a buck from everyone who
comes in. The place is packed.
Just then, two agitated BLACK MEN in their mid-20's push
their way through the line and spot the stereo equipment on
stage. The larger of the two, SMOKEY, grabs Eazy and shoves
him against the wall.
SMOKEY
You the mutha-fucker who stole my
equipment?
EAZY
We were just renting it.
(hands Smokey a stack
of bills)
Here's your cut.
Smokey knocks the wad of bills out of Eazy's hand and punches
him hard. Eazy goes down. Smokey kicks him a few times.
SMOKEY
You think you can buy me off for
chump change? If there's one scratch
on that equipment you're going down!
ONSTAGE
Dre sees Eazy getting beat up and scrambles over a table and
out a small window. People stop dancing and begin making
hasty exits. Yella unplugs the headphones and starts grabbing
up records.
Eazy lies bruised and bleeding by the door as Smokey and his
friend rush the stage and begin dismantling the stereo
equipment.

9.
EXT. WAREHOUSE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
Two PATROL CARS pull up and four COPS step out and begin
herding partygoers against the wall. Various kids are
searched for drugs.
INT. WAREHOUSE - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
The cops have all the people left inside lined up against
the wall. One officer walks over to Eazy and looks at his
black eye and a bloody lip.
OFFICER
Who did this to you?
Point him out.

Is he here?

Eazy glances over at Smokey lined up with the others, cradling
a speaker. Then, he looks at the officer with defiance.
EAZY
I'm not sure which of you cops did
it. You all look the same to me.
Eazy looks at Smokey, who smiles slightly and nods.
EAZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
The cops figured if a bunch of
homeboys were hanging out we had to
be up to no good. That's just the
way it was in Compton. By not ratting
out Smokey, I earned some respect on
the street.
EXT. GREENLEAF AVENUE HOUSE - COMPTON - DAY
Eazy is sitting on the front steps of his boyhood home,
watching the girls on the street walk by.
EAZY
I was tired of scratching around to
make a buck. Bussing tables at
Coco's, getting hassled by my folks
to go back to school...
Eazy watches as a NEW CONVERTIBLE rolls by driven by a
stylishly dressed young MAN in his 20's. This is his cousin
ANTHONY. Sitting next to Anthony in the front seat are two
attractive WOMEN.
EAZY (CONT'D)
I wanted the life my cousin Anthony
had. He was livin' large and had
his pick of the finest bitches around
town.

10.
Eazy watches with envy as Anthony and the girls drive off
down the street.
EAZY (CONT'D)
Turns out Anthony was a dealer. I
didn't have an issue that he was
slinging drugs. To me, business was
business. So I started working for
him.
EXT.

EVE AFTER DARK - NIGHT

We move to the neon sign of Compton's hottest nightclub.
Cars full of hot looking, well-dressed black men and women
pull into the parking lot.
EAZY (V.O.)
After we stopped doing dance parties,
Dre and I started hanging out at the
hottest club in Compton, Eve After
Dark.
AT THE CLUB'S ENTRANCE
An imposing but nicely dressed DOORMAN collects a cover charge
from the people coming in. Next to him is LONZO WILLIAMS,
the club's 25-year-old owner. The gold chains and sharp
suit tell you Lonzo is the local impresario made good.
Affable and direct, Lonzo stands by the door shaking hands
and flirting with the women.
EAZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Eve After Dark was the place to be
and the owner, Lonzo Williams was
the man.
Behind the swarm of well-tailored people entering the club,
we see Eazy and Dre wearing tennis shoes, baseball caps and
T-shirts. Eazy hands a nicely dressed man a few joints and
takes a ten spot from him.
DRE
(shouting)
Hey Lonzo, man!
us in tonight?

How 'bout letting

Lonzo looks over, checks out Eazy and Dre in their street
clothes and starts to laugh.
LONZO
Why the hell would I want two dirty
T-shirt wearing niggas like you in
my club?

11.
Eazy and Dre are pushed aside by the nicely dressed folks
being let in.
EXT.

EVE AFTER DARK CLUB ENTRANCE - LATER

Lonzo steps out, greets some people still in line and lights
a cigarette. Standing in their usual spot are Eazy and Dre.
Eazy's in his street clothes but Dre has put on a nice silk
shirt, black slacks and some sharp wingtip shoes. Lonzo
walks over and inspects Dre.
LONZO
Nice threads. Right this way.
Dre grins and eagerly heads for the club.
Lonzo blocks his way.

Eazy follows but

LONZO (CONT'D)
Not you, little brother. Your friend
showed me some respect tonight but
your raggedy ass still looks the
same. Besides, I don't let drug
dealers inside my club.
Dre reaches the club entrance, turns and shrugs at Eazy.
DRE
See you later, man.
As Eazy watches Dre walk into the club, he looks up at Lonzo
towering over him.
EAZY
Lonzo, someday you're gonna be working
for me.
Lonzo laughs heartily and walks into the club.
EXT.

EVE AFTER DARK - A WEEK LATER - NIGHT

It's late. Inside, the club is at full capacity. Lonzo is
in the parking lot as two COPS, one white, one black, are in
his face, giving him a hard time.
EAZY (V.O.)
Lonzo was old school and clean as a
whistle. But the cops didn't trust
a brother who made money. They
figured he had to be doing something
illegal. And if one of the cops was
black, he always had to prove he
wasn't playing favorites by being
real hard.

12.
As MUSIC blares out of the club behind them, the black cop
grabs Lonzo's neck chain and snaps it off.
Sitting nearby, Eazy is
slacks, but still wears

now dressed in a silk shirt and
his baseball cap. He watches the
two cops walk away. Lonzo retrieves
ground, sees Eazy watching and walks

LONZO
What's your name, little brother?
Eazy stands as tall as he can but he's still a foot shorter
than Lonzo.
EAZY
Eazy "Mutherfuckin" E.
LONZO
You can come in as long as you don't
sell any weed inside the club.
EAZY
Thanks, Lonzo.
Lonzo takes off Eazy's baseball cap and leads him inside.
INT.

EVE AFTER DARK - CONTINUOUS

The place is packed with hot-looking black men and women.
Lots of fedoras and silk. A pounding music beat fills the
air. Eazy moves through the room and soaks in the scene.
EAZY (V.O.)
I'd spent weeks in the parking lot
picturing what it would be like
inside, but it was even better than
I imagined. Eve gave all these
Compton homies a place where they
could forget about the bullshit on
the street and lose themselves in
the music.
Eazy spots Dre and cuts through the crowd to get to him.
EAZY (CONT'D)
Hey Dre!
Dre smiles and walks over.
DRE
What's up, homie?

Where'd you steal

EAZY

This place is tight.
DRE
Check it out. Lonzo's gonna let me

to get some new records. Can you
help me out?
EAZY
Don't worry, I'll cover you. You
and me are partners. Pretty soon
we'll be running this place.
Eazy high-fives his friend.

EXT.

ROADIUM SWAP MEET - DAY

It's five years later. 1985. We pull back from a new set
of SUNGLASSES to reveal a more adult Eazy, good-looking and
confident as ever, wearing a black cap with an "Oakland
Raiders" insignia, driving a Suzuki Samurai.
Eazy pulls his Suzuki Samurai under the grand ARCHWAY that
leads into the main swap meet area. He parks his Suzuki in
the lot and climbs out.
Across the way, it's bustling with activity and enterprise.
Tables and stands are set up in a series of rows with VENDORS
hawking every conceivable kind of merchandise. Eazy walks
past a SMALL STAGE where a D.J. named GREG MACK is spinning
records. We see the call letters KDAY on a banner behind
him. As a song ends, Mack looks out at the crowd.
MACK
You're listening to KDAY coming to
you live from the Roadium. Whatever
you need, you'll find it here. So
come on over and say hello. I'm
Greg Mack and this is a track from
L.A. Dream Team.

14.
Mack puts the needle on the record and the music blasts
through the swap meet. Eazy gets out of his vehicle and
walks over to a VENDOR named STEVE YANO. Steve is a lanky,
wire thin Japanese guy selling 12" vinyl records and audio
cassettes on a large table. A small crowd of customers are
pouring over the merchandise.
EAZY
Hey Stevie, what's happenin'?
Eazy E!

STEVE
My man!

They knock their fists together in a neighborhood greeting.
Steve moves over to a black TEENAGE GIRL looking at a
cassette.
Eazy looks over and gives a slight nod to a black TEENAGE
BOY who's pretending to look at some records. The teenage
boy nods back, then walks past Eazy. As he passes, Eazy
quickly slips a small PACKET into the teenage boy's hand.
The teenage boy walks away, discreetly dropping some MONEY
on the TABLE.
After a beat - Eazy scoops the money up off the table and
walks over to Steve, who's talking to the teenage girl.
STEVE (CONT'D)
What you got there is the best of
the LA Dream Team. I'm the exclusive
dealer of that shit. You blink and
it's gone.
TEENAGE GIRL
How much is it?
STEVE
Seven dollars and it's yours baby.
The girl pays him, smiles at Eazy and walks away.
STEVE (CONT'D)
(to Eazy)
She wants you.
Steve lifts his shirt, revealing a MONEY BELT.
and tucks in the cash the girl just paid him.

He unzips it

As Steve zips up the money belt, Eazy can't help but catch a
glimpse of the thick WAD of BILLS inside.
EAZY
Fuck, Steve, you make that kind of
green selling records and shit?

15.
Steve winks at Eazy as he smooths his shirt tails back down.
STEVE
You just gotta know what the brothers
want.
Eazy and Steve step back over to his vending table.
starts rifling through some of his records.

Eazy

EAZY
What are you selling here?
STEVE
The local homegrown stuff is hot.
L.A. Dream Team, Egyptian Lover, all
the stuff they play on KDAY.
EAZY
Does Lonzo's stuff sell?
STEVE
The Wrecking Cru? Yeah, man, they
got Dre. Dre's the shit.
Eazy nods with a slight grin.
Cool.

EAZY
I'll see you later, man.

Eazy walks away and takes a good look around the swap meet.
Along with the KDAY set-up there's MUSIC BLARING everywhere
from cars and boom boxes. A dozen different VENDORS are
selling records and tapes.
There's something special happening here. It's all over
Eazy's face. His mind is spinning. He wants in.

EXT.

MACOLA RECORDS - WAREHOUSE - DAY

A hand slices open the top of a BOX and folds back the flap.
Inside is a stack of "Wrecking Cru" RECORDS.
PULL BACK
To reveal a small, tacky RECORD PRESSING PLANT. It's the
bottom of the music industry food chain. Machines are
pressing records and WORKERS with forklifts package and stack
them. A WORKER picks up the box and carries it down the
hall.
INT.

MACOLA RECORDS - SMALL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Sitting in a cramped office is JERRY HELLER, 44.

16.
Grizzled and hung-over, Jerry is sifting through some records
that are stacked up in front of him. The framed PICTURES on
his office wall tell the whole story. There's Jerry with
Elton John, with John Fogerty, with Elvis.
Jerry stands, stretches and looks at himself in one of the
pictures. There was a fire in his eyes back then. He's
younger, happier, in his element. Although the fire still
flickers today, he looks a little desperate in these
surroundings.
Jerry looks over at an impressive leather DESK CHAIR wrapped
in plastic. It's a chair that carries a special significance
for Jerry. It reminds him of who he used to be.
The worker comes into the office with the box.
WORKER
Hi Jerry. One thousand World Class
Wrecking Cru singles coming up.
JERRY
Thanks.
The worker drops them down on the desk and hands Jerry an
invoice. Jerry signs it and the worker walks away.
MOVE IN CLOSE
Jerry slips one of the "Wrecking Cru" singles out of the
box. There's a PICTURE of the group on the record sleeve.
The group members include Lonzo, who we recognize from Eve
After Dark and Dr. Dre, now in his early 20's and D.J. Yella.
As Jerry seals the box back up Macola's head guy, DON
MACMILLAN pops into his doorway. He's a throwback to the
disco era, with his shirt collar tucked over his jacket and
a gaudy gold chain on his wrist.
Hey babe.

MACMILLAN
How's it going?

JERRY
(dryly)
Living the fucking dream.
MACMILLAN
You know with all the records you
got me pressing maybe I should start
looking into music management.

MACMILLAN
Anything hot coming up?
JERRY
Nothing major. This Wrecking Cru
song "Turn Out The Lights" is getting
a good buzz at some of the clubs.
I think it might be radio friendly.
MacMillan nods with more than casual interest. Jerry stands
and hoists the box onto his shoulder and turns to MacMillan.
JERRY (CONT'D)
I'm still looking for that breakout
record.
EXT. MACOLA RECORDS PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
Jerry puts the box in the trunk of his 1972 Lincoln
Continental. The car of a player in an earlier era. He
closes the trunk and notices a gash in the faded paint.
Jerry's spits in his hand and rubs the scratch. It doesn't
come out. He walks around and gets in the car.

Jerry starts the car and turns on the RADIO. It's KDAY

A middle class school in the heart of the San Fernando Valley.
Predominantly white STUDENTS are walking across the wellmanicured lawn, heading to classes, carrying books and
knapsacks.

TAFT STUDENT ADVISOR'S OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The Kool Mo Dee song is still playing, only now we hear it
through the Sony Walkman HEADPHONES of O'SHEA JACKSON, a
gruff-looking heavy-set 17-year-old black student.
O'Shea sits scribbling in a notebook, lost in the song when
MR. TAYLOR, his student advisor steps out of the office and
clears his throat.

18.
MR. TAYLOR
Mr. Jackson?
O'Shea doesn't see him as he bops to the beat.
MR. TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Mr. Jackson?
O'Shea is focused on what's he writing. Mr. Taylor finally
steps over and lifts off one side of his headset. O'Shea
looks up and takes off his headphones.
O'SHEA
Hey, Mr. Taylor.
MR. TAYLOR

MR. TAYLOR'S OFFICE - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Mr. Taylor is looking over some papers as O'Shea sits across
from him.
MR. TAYLOR
The picture here is very promising.
You're testing well in a number of
subjects.
(he flips a page)
You've got a B average. Are you
starting to consider your college
choices?
O'SHEA
My folks got me some applications.
I haven't had time to fill them out
yet.
MR. TAYLOR
I know you get up every day at 6:30
to take the bus here from Compton.
So, it would be a shame not to
consider all your opportunities.
O'SHEA
To tell you the truth, Mr. Taylor,
I'd really like to do something with
my music. I've been writing a lot
of songs. I think I could do
something with that.

19.
MR. TAYLOR
Well, if you have an interest in
music I'm surprised you haven't joined
the school band.
O'SHEA
That's not really my kind of music.
MR. TAYLOR
How do you know if you don't try?
MR. Taylor hits his INTERCOM buzzer.
MR. TAYLOR (CONT'D)
Julie, could you bring in a band

Mr. Taylor gives O'Shea an encouraging smile.

You know, I played the oboe.

Jerry walks over to a pretty RECEPTIONIST sitting underneath
a "Priority Records" logo.
JERRY
Kim, I'm supposed to talk to Bryan

RECEPTIONIST
I can squeeze you in, Jerry, but
he's leaving early to go to the hockey

Okay.

PRIORITY RECORDS - BRYAN TURNER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

BRYAN TURNER, late 20's, is wrapping up a meeting with two
of his young executives, DANNY and STEVE. Turner's got the
look and demeanor of a guy who's on easy street.

20.
TURNER
Alright guys, let's pick this up
tomorrow. Jerry Heller's coming
over.
The two execs change a look of amusement.
DANNY
Jerry Heller? Is he still alive?
TURNER
He used to have an office down the
hall.
STEVE
Heller's bad fucking news, Bryan.
He's a horror show. Nobody wants to
work with him.
TURNER
Don't forget he came up with Geffen
and Azoff. He found Pink Floyd, for
God sakes. I just want to see where
his head's at.
There's a knock on the door and Jerry is led in by Turner's
SECRETARY.
TURNER (CONT'D)
Jerry, come on in.
Jerry enters and shakes Turner's hand.
TURNER (CONT'D)
These are two of my guys Danny and
Steve.
Jerry gives the guys a slight nod then sits down and zooms
in on Turner.
JERRY
Did you listen to those tapes I
dropped off?
TURNER
Yeah I did, Jerry. To be honest,
they didn't blow my skirt up.
JERRY
Listen again, Bryan. Costs are out
of control in this business. My
guys are making records for 600 bucks
on a four-track in their basement.

21.
JERRY (CONT'D)
They're pressing their own singles
and selling them at swap meets.
We're moving between five and ten
thousand copies of these records in
L.A. alone and that's without any
airplay or promotion. The kids are
hearing the music in clubs and seeking
it out. This is the next chapter in
music.
Turner nods, listening to Jerry's pitch. Then he picks up a
videotape and slides it into a VCR on his desk.
TURNER
Jerry, let me show you the next
chapter in music.
A TV set on Turner's desk flickers to life. ONSCREEN - A
group of animated RAISIN PUPPETS break into the song "Heard
It Through The Grapevine."
TURNER (CONT'D)
"The California Raisins." It's easy.
It's simple. Kids like California.
They like raisins and they like
Motown. It's already a highly
successful ad campaign and we just
bought the rights for an album.
It's money in the bank.
Jerry can't hide his disgust.
PUPPET off Turner's desk.

He picks up a bobbing RAISIN

JERRY
Are you fucking kidding? Recycled
Motown songs sung by dancing prunes?
This is the death of the industry.
TURNER
(with a grin)
Tell me what you really think, Jerry.
Look, there's no way this ghetto
shit you're pushing ever gets any
airplay. It's regional. You're
never going to move it outside the
swap meets.
Jerry stands and picks up his box of records.
JERRY
Bryan, you're dead fucking wrong.
This is the next wave and you're
going to miss the boat.

Jerry walks out.
Wow.

DANNY
He's really lost it.

TURNER
Maybe. (Beat) Maybe not.

The car is idling in a Compton alley. Eazy's cousin Anthony

Anthony tosses Eazy a wad of CASH.

Eazy takes it and thumbs

EAZY
Jesus, Anthony. How the fuck did

ANTHONY
I'm making moves. I sent a crew

EAZY
You crazy, nigga? You can't sell

ANTHONY
Fuck that. Who says they got
exclusive rights to those corners?
There's money out there and I need
to expand. Besides, what the fuck
are they gonna do about it?

23.
As Anthony is finishing his sentence a GANG MEMBER suddenly
appears outside the driver's side WINDOW, raises his PISTOL
and SHOOTS Anthony point blank in the head. The car window
SHATTERS as Anthony is hit and blood splatters everywhere.
Eazy ducks down to the floor of the car as the gang member
FIRES at Anthony several more times.
In the mayhem of bullets and blood, Eazy crouches on the
floor and pops the car's STICK SHIFT into reverse. He reaches
over Anthony's bloody body, grabs the steering wheel and
presses down on the gas pedal with his other hand.
EXT. COMPTON ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
The car is in reverse as it barrels BACKWARDS down the alley
with a dead Anthony at the wheel. The gang member runs off
in the other direction.
The mustang is accelerating in reverse until it smashes into
a brick building at the end of the alley.
The passenger side door of the mustang swings open. Eazy
climbs out and with a slight limp makes a run for it.

EVE AFTER DARK - NIGHT

Five years have passed since we first saw it but Eve's is
still the hottest club in Compton. The parking lot is
crammed. A line of well-dressed people waiting to get in
winds around the building. Pounding MUSIC pours out from
inside.
INT.

EVE AFTER DARK - CONTINUOUS

In a D.J. BOOTH wearing a sequined doctor's suit is DR. DRE,
now 22. He moves gracefully to the music as we watch his
hands mix from two turntables with an effortless touch. The
writhing masses on the dance floor appear to speak to him.
He's the main attraction. As his song mix ends, the crowd
applauds and he addresses them on a microphone.
DRE
That was the one and only Grandmaster
Flash. I'm mix master Dr. Dre and
here's something from my posse, The
World Class Wrecking Cru called "Turn
Out The lights."
The music plays as we move to the BAR and find Jerry Heller
sipping a drink. He's the only white guy for miles but he
looks unusually comfortable as he listens to the music.
AT THE ENTRANCE

24.
Eazy E struts in wearing his trademark Raiders cap, sunglasses
and sparkling white AIR JORDAN high-tops. He's with a HOT
DATE in a tight dress but that doesn't stop him from checking
some of the other ladies milling around. He waves to one,
nods to another. It's obvious Eazy gets around.
Eazy's eyes scan the room, moving past the women and
eventually land on Lonzo, who's walking over to Jerry.
EAZY'S DATE
You look good in those new shoes,
baby.
Eazy isn't listening. He's watching intently as Lonzo talks
with Jerry. Eazy's date starts getting antsy.
EAZY'S DATE (CONT'D)
You better not be looking at some
other bitch when I'm standing right
here.
Eazy turns and gives her a kiss.
EAZY
Don't be that way, baby. You know
you're the only girl for me. Eazy'll
be right back.
AT THE BAR
We move to Jerry and Lonzo's conversation.
JERRY
Dre seems to be packing them in for
you.
LONZO
He better be. Dre's so broke he
can't pay attention. He's got his

LONZO (CONT'D)

Give my man, Jerry, whatever he wants
on the house.
Lonzo walks away but doesn't get too far before he's
intercepted by Eazy.
EAZY
Hey, Lonzo. Who's the white dude?
The only white face I ever seen in
here was a cop.
LONZO
That's no cop. That's Jerry Heller.
Music manager. He's gonna get The
Cru hooked up with CBS records. If
I can keep Dre from spending all the
fucking money.
Lonzo walks away. Eazy smiles and studies Jerry as he sits
at the bar. Then he turns to see Lonzo at the D.J. booth
talking to Dre. Eazy watches with interest as Dre and Lonzo
get into an argument.
AT A TABLE
Smokey, from Eazy and Dre's ill-fated dance party, sits with
two BODYGUARDS. Everyone in the immediate vicinity looks at
Smokey with respect. Smokey's focused on 8 BALL, a
charismatic hustler who sits nuzzling two large breasted
HOOKERS a few tables away.
Smokey waves over a WAITRESS.
SMOKEY
Gimme a wild turkey, bourbon and
whiskey. What's that called again?
WAITRESS

The waitress arrives and puts the drinks down on Smokey's
table and leaves. Smokey slides one of the drinks over to
Eazy.
SMOKEY
I need you to deliver this for me.
This gives Eazy pause as he follows Smokey's gaze over to 8
Ball who is nuzzling his women.
EAZY
This about 8 Ball?

27.
SMOKEY
He couldn't wipe his ass two years
ago. Now he's got a dick a mile
long. He couldn't even tell you how
much he owes me.
Eazy picks up the drink and starts walking to 8 Ball's table.
Everyone in the club except 8 Ball seems to be aware that
something may go down.
AT THE DJ BOOTH
Dre is watching Eazy as he walks towards 8 Ball.

Eazy watches as Lonzo's floor men carry a bloodied 8 Ball

to him.

Hey Eazy.

LISA

EAZY
Nigga had too much to drink.
LISA

LADIES RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eazy's date enters and goes to the mirror to check her makeup. She hears someone whispering low in one of the stalls.
We recognize EAZY'S VOICE as he moans with pleasure. Eazy's
date bends down and sees a woman's legs kneeling down in
front of Eazy's NEW SNEAKERS. His pant cuffs are loosely
gathered at his ankles. Furious, she walks over and begins
pounding on the stall door.
EAZY'S DATE
Eazy, you motherfucker!
EAZY (O.S.)
Come on, baby, don't be like that.
She pounds so hard on the stall door it swings open revealing
Eazy getting a blow job from Lisa. Eazy quickly scrambles
to get his pants up. Eazy's date turns her wrath onto Lisa
as she stands and composes herself.
EAZY'S DATE
You fucking slut! Get your own man!
LISA
I had him first, bitch.
The two girls begin to fight, pulling hair and screaming.
Eazy isn't going to stick around to see who wins.

Dre and Eazy walk to the curb and stop at Dre's RX-7, which

the car's windshield, tears it off casually, opens the trunk

He's written some really tight lyrics.
But I can't get into Lonzo's studio
to lay down the tracks.
EAZY
What's the problem?
DRE
Lonzo says I gotta pay him upfront
and I'm a little light. I got some
East Coast cats coming in to do the
vocals and Lonzo's fucking up the
whole deal.
EAZY
I got the cash to cover it. This

equipment for you.

You the man, Eazy.
EAZY
Lets get something going and we can
bring it to the old boy who manages

DRE
Jerry? You better ask Lonzo about
that. He handles the business.
Just then a quick burst of a POLICE SIREN makes Eazy and Dre
turn to see:
DOWN THE STREET
A couple of HOMEBOYS walking home are being checked out by a
patrol car. The officers stop, climb out and with batons
drawn order the men up against a fence. Eazy and Dre watch
as the cops aggressively pat the men down.

New York rap group HBO and his friend O'Shea who's now known
as ICE CUBE. Cube is scribbling in a notebook while Dre is
at the mixing board and Yella is setting the levels. Some
teenage girls are hanging around. Another one of Dre's
musician friends, ARABIAN PRINCE, is hanging out hitting on
the girls. We move to Eazy a few feet away, talking on his
cell phone.
EAZY

Don't be that way, baby. I'm just
handlin' a little business. I been
thinking about you all day. I gotta

Eazy ends the call and watches with interest as Dre and Cube
confer with the members of HBO. There's an energy in the
recording studio that Eazy's enjoying.
Lonzo pokes his head in to see what's going on and Eazy walks
over to him.
EAZY (CONT'D)
Cool studio, man.
LONZO
I bought this house from Johnny Otis.
I made some upgrades but the studio's
pretty much the way Johnny left it.
(to Dre)
How we paying for today's session?
I'm paying.

EAZY
Cash okay?

LONZO
I got no problem with cash.
Eazy pulls some cash out of his sock and gives it to Lonzo.

EAZY
You know, I want to get more involved
in the music scene. Dre said you
could introduce me to Jerry Heller.
LONZO
Come on, Eazy. You're a dealer.
Jerry Heller don't want to meet you.
EAZY
I'm out of that.
Dre now.

I'm working with

LONZO
You're using dope money to pay for
studio time. That don't make you a

Eazy doesn't like hearing this but he keeps his cool. He
looks back in the studio, sees the three members of HBO
arguing with Dre and Cube and walks over.
EAZY
What's going on?
DRE
They don't like the lyrics.
HBO MEMBER 1
We ain't singing this West Coast
bullshit. We're East Coast.
CUBE
Where the fuck are you? This is the
West Coast. We got a way of doing
things here.
HBO MEMBER 2
We got more of a Run-DMC vibe.
CUBE
You ain't no Run-DMC.
Eazy sees that Cube is simmering and steps over.
EAZY
This is Compton. If you ain't down
with that then go back to muthafuckin' New York.
The HBO boys gather their stuff, shouting obscenities at
Eazy as they walk by Lonzo who's been watching from the
doorway. They leave. Suddenly the room goes silent.
Dre starts turning off the equipment in frustration.

Eazy looks up from the page, then starts reading some more
of the lyrics.
EAZY

I gotta Get Drunk Before the Day
Begin, Before My Mother Starts
Bitchin' About My Friends...
Dre stops taking the tape off the tape deck. He looks at
Cube and they acknowledge that Eazy doesn't sound bad.
DRE
Maybe Eazy should sing it. He paid
for the session. Let him give it a
try.
Me?

EAZY
I don't know...

Yeah, Eazy.

YELLA
You should do it.

LONZO
(rolls his eyes)
So I guess Eazy's a rapper now, too.
Cube looks over to Dre, and cracks a smile.
CUBE
Fine with me. Let's do this, E.
Dre hands Eazy a set of headphones. Eazy slides them on as
Dre steps over to the mixing board and starts pressing
buttons.

34.
EAZY
Shit. If I gotta sing this at least
cut the lights in here...
Yella walks over and hits the light switch. Eazy slips on
his sunglasses and stands in the now darkened room, the lights
from the mixing board meters throw shadows on the wall.
EAZY (CONT'D)

Gimme a second....
All the guys are watching Eazy as he steps up to the
MICROPHONE. He takes a moment to prepare, then nods to Dre.
Dre hits the playback button and the song's rumbling BASS
LINES begin.
Eazy takes a deep breath, and begins to rap the opening lines
of "Boyz In The Hood" like he's been rehearsing for this
moment his whole life.
EAZY (CONT'D)
...Woke Up Quick At About Noon, Just
Thought That I Had To Be In Compton
Soon, I gotta Get Drunk Before the
Day Begin, Before My Mother Starts

Eazy's high-pitched voice appears to fit surprisingly well
with Dre's tracks. Everyone around the room nods their
approval except for Lonzo who is noticeably unimpressed.
EAZY (CONT'D)
...About To Go And Damn It Went Blind,
Young Niggaz At The Pad Throwin' Up

The song fades down as we hear Eazy's V.O. come up...
EAZY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
We spent all night in the studio.
We must have recorded it 25 times

Alright, Eazy. I've only got a few

got.
Eazy puts a 12" single on the stereo's turntable and puts up
the volume and the fully produced "Boys In The Hood" begins
to play.
As the song begins, Jerry's demeanor changes. He's hit by
lightning. Eazy notices the change and a slight smile crosses
his face. Jerry is momentarily lost in the song's edgy,
driving story. As the song finishes the first chorus, Jerry
turns the volume down and looks at Eazy.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Who's the singer? Is that you?
EAZY
It's me with Dre and some other guys.
JERRY
This doesn't sound like Dre's regular
stuff. Did you write this song?
EAZY
It was one of my guys.

Jerry turns the volume back up and listens. A startling
resolve hits him. He lives for moments like this. In his
face we see that he recognizes this is the music he's been
waiting to find. As the song finishes, Jerry stands, thinks
for a moment and then looks at Eazy.
JERRY
Have you got other stuff like this?
EAZY
I got a ton of shit. See, Dre wants
to work with me now. He's not feeling
that Doctor suit bullshit any more.
This music is what he's about, it's
what I'm about. Every nigga in South
Central with a system in his car is
gonna be playing this.
Jerry's mind is racing but his demeanor is cool.
EAZY (CONT'D)
I want you to do for me what you
been doing with all those other
groups. Manage me. You got contacts
and I want to start my own label.
Jerry pauses for a moment to think.

Then he makes a decision.

JERRY
Okay.
EAZY
Okay you'll be my manager?
JERRY
That's right. I'll manage you and
work for the label. For that I get
20%. For every dollar made, I get
20 cents. That's off the top. Dollar
one. Day one. You understand?
EAZY
That sounds fine. But since it's
going to be my record label, I don't
want no other company putting their
name on my records.
JERRY
That's not the way it's done, kid.
EAZY
That's the way I'm gonna do it, Jerry.
I don't follow nobody else's rules.
Jerry smiles.

He likes Eazy's chutzpah.

ICE CUBE'S HOUSE - DAY

Dre and Cube are kicking back on the porch. Dre is playing
some beats on a BOOM BOX as Cube reads some raps from a piece
of paper.

CUBE
A bitch is a bitch, So if I'm poor
or rich, I talk in the exact same
pitch, Now the title bitch don't
apply to all women, But all women
have a little bitch in 'em, It's
like a disease that's plagues their
character, Takin' the women of
America, And it starts with a letter
B..
Cube's mother appears at the SCREEN DOOR. She's an attractive
black woman in her 40's. She looks shocked at what she's
hearing.
CUBE (CONT'D)
...It makes a girl like that think
she better than me, See, some get
mad and some just bury, But, yo, if
the shoe fits wear it, It makes 'em
go deaf in the ear, That's why when
you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi', Are
you the kind that think you're too
damn fly? Bitch eat shit 'n die,
Ice Cube comin' at you at crazy pitch,
Why? I think a bitch is a bitch.
Cube's mother swings open the screen door and steps onto the
porch.
CUBE'S MOM
O'Shea! What on earth are you saying?
Did you say what I think you said?
Dre can't help but grin as Cube looks embarrassed at his
mother's interruption.

beat, Eazy climbs out wearing new clothes and new sunglasses.
All eyes are on him as he walks toward the house.
CUBE'S MOM
Well, look at that.
Eazy walks onto the porch and grins at his new car.
EAZY
Whatcha think?
DRE
Where'd you steal those wheels?
EAZY
I got money.
Cube and Dre exchange a quick look of envy. Cube shakes his
head as he looks at the beat up pickup truck he's driving.
CUBE
Shit.

CUBE (CONT'D)
I'm writing the songs. You're
producing everything and Eazy's the
one with the new wheels.
Just then Jerry enters and Cube walks over to him with the
Billboard.
CUBE (CONT'D)
Shit, for your 20 percent I can get

Jerry breaks into a wide grin and takes the Billboard from

Eazy. Jerry notices that D.O.C. is talking it up with his
new bodyguard, 320-pound SUGE KNIGHT, a charismatic hulk
with a touch of menace.
JERRY
Eazy, this is my cousin Gary. He's
going to help manage the tour. He's

Gary looks at Jerry, confused.

GARY

Grab Eazy's duffel bag will ya?
Gary strains slightly and has to use all his strength to
pick up Eazy's heavy duffel bag. Cube walks by with Dre and
checks out Gary climbing on the bus with Eazy's bag.
CUBE

This asshole's his fucking cousin.
How much is he getting?
IN THE PARKING LOT
Jerry walks over to D.O.C. who's chatting with Suge.

TOUR BUS - CONTINUOUS

Eazy, Cube, Dre and the other guys are all flopping down in
their seats. Several other heavy set BODY GUARDS are also
on the bus. Two burley SAMOAN TWINS sit on the bus behind
Eazy.
Gary struggles down the aisle with the heavy bag. He finds
Eazy and drops the duffel bag with a thud next to his seat.
GARY
What the hell have you got in this
bag? It weighs a ton.
Eazy smiles, unzips the duffel bag and pulls out an AK47
ASSAULT RIFLE.

62.
EAZY
It's a lot lighter when the clip's
not in it.
Gary is stunned. He looks around as all the guys start
laughing and begin pulling out a wide assortment of handguns
and assault rifles from their bags.
Jerry pokes his head in, sees all the guns and looks alarmed.
JERRY
Eazy, I need to talk to you outside.
Eazy puts the gun down and climbs off the bus.
EXT. AUDIO ACHIEVEMENTS STUDIO - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
Eazy walks over to Jerry who turns to him sternly.
JERRY
You can't bring those guns out on

EAZY
We're bringing the guns.
JERRY
Look, Eazy, this whole gang-banger

He thinks for a minute, searching

JERRY
All right, why don't we put the AK47's

Eazy takes a moment to ponder Jerry's request.
EAZY
Okay.
Jerry nods his approval, though it's clear he's been made
uneasy by this whole situation. They climb back onboard.

As the bus speeds to their next stop, Jerry sits behind the
driver studying the tour schedule, oblivious to the sea of
half-naked WOMEN frolicking with the group members in the
seats behind him. All the guys have girls except for Cube
who sits alone, scribbling lyrics into a notebook. Jerry's
cell phone rings and he picks up.
Hello?

JERRY

While Jerry listens, he turns around and spots Eazy making
out with a GIRL in a back seat behind him.
A FEW AISLES BACK
Eazy and the girl are getting hot and heavy when his cell
phone RINGS. Eazy squirms out of an embrace to pick up his
phone.
EAZY
Yeah?

Eazy, it's Jerry.
EAZY

Eazy leans out into the aisle and sees Jerry waving to him.
The girl pulls him back.
JERRY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Listen, the shows in St. Louis and
San Antonio have been canceled.
EAZY
Why?
JERRY (O.S.)
"Fuck Tha Police" is freaking
everybody out. The cops hate the
song and won't provide security.
Eazy is half listening. He tries to squirm away from the
girl who's now kissing his neck.
EAZY
So, fuck 'em.
JERRY (O.S.)
Look, I have to go back to L.A.
tomorrow but when you get to Detroit
maybe you should skip "Fuck Tha
Police" until this thing dies down.
EAZY
I don't think I'm down with that.

JERRY (O.S.)
Just think about it. This could be
a problem.
Easy hangs up as the girl he's with peels off her top and
DROPS OUT OF THE FRAME.
Dre has been sitting in the seat behind Eazy listening to
beats on a Walkman. A girl is sleeping on his shoulder.
Dre slides off his headphones and taps Eazy on the shoulder.
DRE
What was that all about?
EAZY
Just business. Me and Jerry will
handle it.
Eazy closes his eyes as he watches the head of the girl in
his lap bob up and down. Dre looks annoyed as Suge leans
forward from the seat behind him with a devilish grin.
SUGE
Guess Jerry and Eazy are running the
show?
Dre doesn't respond.

Suge lets the moment linger.

SUGE (CONT'D)
You know, I'm working the Bobby Brown
show in L.A. in a couple of weeks.
Wanna meet him?

A dozen uniformed and plain-clothes POLICEMEN flood the stage.

This isn't some activist group, Jerry.
This is the FBI. What happens when

got to put a muzzle on this track.
JERRY
Nobody's putting a muzzle on anything.
That song is the reason the album is

TURNER
Jerry, I've got a responsibility to

of speech issue. We may lose some
tour dates but all this press is
just going to put more money in your

Nobody's fucking listening.
TURNER (O.S.)
Listen, I think everybody knows you're
the one coming up with all the great
lyrics. You're the nerve center of
the group. You can definitely carry
a record by yourself and if that's
what you want to do Priority would
get behind you.
CUBE
We should talk, man.

Just me and

TURNER (O.S.)
I'm your biggest fan, Ice. We should

Cube's not sure about this.
Yeah.

CUBE
I guess.

TURNER (O.S.)
I'm looking out for you, Ice. Jerry
wanted to pull "Fuck Tha Police" off
the album but I wouldn't let him.
You gotta watch that son-of-a-bitch.
Cube is simmering as Turner lays it on.

INT. PHOENIX STADIUM

BACKSTAGE HALLWAY

Eazy catches up to Cube as he heads for the exit.
Hey!

EAZY
What the fuck is your problem?

CUBE
I'm sick of this shit, Eazy. I'm
not playing another sold out show
until I get a better deal.
EAZY
I told you we're gonna settle up
when we get back to L.A.
CUBE
Fuck you and fuck Jerry Heller. I
want to see where all the money's
going. You tell him I want to see
the books.
Cube pushes open the exit door and walks out into the
sunlight. Eazy is fuming.

RUTHLESS RECORDS OFFICE - DAY

Jerry enters and stops in his office doorway. Suge Knight
is in his office with his back to us, staring at Jerry's big
leather desk chair. Jerry takes a moment to size up the
situation.

77.
JERRY
You want that seat, don't you Suge?
Suge is startled.

He turns and gives Jerry a big smile.

SUGE
Why you sneaking up on a brother
like that, Jerry? I been standing
here waiting for you.
JERRY
I didn't think it was possible to
sneak up on someone in my own office.
Jerry walks around Suge and sits down at his desk.
SUGE
I'm here because D.O.C. has asked me
to take a look at his contract with
Ruthless.
JERRY
(surprised)
His contract? Why?
Suge sits down and flashes Jerry a huge bear smile.
SUGE
I'm managing him now. You can't do
it all, Jerry. You gotta spread
some of the cheddar around to keep
everyone happy.
Jerry's not sure how to take all this, when his assistant
CONNY pops her head in.
CONNY

Eazy's still in the hallway as CREW MEMBERS pass by him

RUTHLESS RECORDS - JERRY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

As Jerry listens to Eazy on the phone he can't help but notice

EAZY (O.S.)
We got a sold out house here, Jerry.
And Cube's singing half the fuckin'
songs.
JERRY
(thinks for a moment)
I'll be there in two hours.
Jerry hangs up, stands and grabs his briefcase. As he steps
into the outer office, Suge puts down a file he's looking
at.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Suge, something came up. We're gonna
have to go over this another time.

PHOENIX HOTEL - EAZY'S ROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Eazy, Dre, Cube, Yella and MC Ren listen as Jerry passes out
contracts and Bryan Turner stands nearby.

79.
JERRY
We were going to wait until you
finished the tour but I know some of
you guys are getting impatient
regarding money issues. So we've
brought along new upgraded contracts

envelopes)
We're going to advance each of you
$75,000 on your royalties for
"Straight Outta Compton."
YELLA
Holy shit.
DRE
'Bout fuckin' time.
Jerry hands them their checks. MC Ren and Yella
enthusiastically take them and sign their contracts. Dre is
more tentative but signs. Cube is silent, impassive. He
exchanges a private look with Bryan Turner. Jerry steps
over and hands Cube his check.
CUBE
I ain't signing nothing. Not 'til
my attorney looks at the contract

Jerry looks over at Eazy and Eazy plays it cool.
Fine.

EAZY
You don't wanna sign.

Don't

Eazy picks up Cube's contract and nonchalantly TEARS it in
half. Then he takes Cube's check from Jerry and tucks it
into his pocket. Jerry looks pissed as he glowers at Cube.
JERRY
Hey, I came all the way down here
for you and now you're not taking
the check and signing your deal?
CUBE
This is bullshit. I'm making the
same amount of money as Yella and
Ren and I'm writing half the songs.
Fuck that. And why the fuck are you

Jerry is livid. He picks up a table lamp, yanks the chord
out of the wall and throws it full force at Ice Cube. Cube
barely ducks in time as it smashes against the wall. He
glares at Jerry.

Come on, old man. Let's go!
Cube starts to lunge at Jerry but Dre and Ren hold him back.

LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Jerry, Eazy and their LAWYERS are in a heated discussion

Ice Cube.

EAZY (V.O.)

A door opens and Suge and Dre step in from the outside
corridor. The security guard watching the door recognizes
Suge. Suge smiles and he and the guard touch their fists
together.
SUGE
What's going on?

This is Dre.

SECURITY GUARD
How you doing? Bobby's wrapping up
his last song.
Suge scans the room and sees a gorgeous BLACK WOMAN flirting
with a WELL-DRESSED MAN.
SUGE
(to the security guard)
Who's the mutha-fucker hitting on
Bobby's girl?
The security guard is listening to something on his headset.
He just shrugs at Suge. Suge's eyes narrow a bit as he
watches the well-dressed man leaning in close to Bobby's
girl. She's laughing at something he said as he reaches up
and touches her hair.
SUGE (CONT'D)
(to Dre)
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Suge crosses the room, his eyes fixed on Bobby's girl and
the man she's flirting with. He steps up next to them and
stands there until the well-dressed man looks over at him.
WELL DRESSED MAN
Can I help you?
SUGE
I need you to step out of the area.

82.
WELL DRESSED MAN
I'm with the label, asshole.
Before the guy knows what hit him - Suge SLAMS him in the
face with his beefy fist.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Dre is mesmerized as he watches Suge dispatch the man with a
series of lighting fast blows. Bobby's girl steps back and
quickly disappears. The well-dressed man crumbles to the
floor as two SECURITY GUARDS move in and take him out the
back exit.
Suge smooths out his jacket as he walks back over to Dre.
SUGE
Bobby will be out in a second.
Dre looks at Suge with respect.
INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD CLUB - NIGHT
It's a crowded, noisy night spot. Pounding music makes it
difficult to be heard as CLUB GOERS lean in and shout their
drink orders to the BARTENDERS.
Eazy comes strolling through the maze of people handing out
FLYERS with a posse of his friends, including BIG RON, a 350pound bruiser who Eazy sometimes calls his bodyguard.
As he walks through the dark club passing out flyers and
signing autographs, Eazy is scanning the female talent pool,
deciding which of the lovely WOMEN he might want to meet
that night.
EXT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD CLUB - OUTSIDE TERRACE - CONTINUOUS
Eazy and his posse make their way outside with their flyers
and stand in the patio doorway. Eazy continues to check out
the ladies, trying to find one that catches his interest.
EAZY'S POV
Move to THE BAR. A group of young WOMEN are talking and
laughing. Sitting among them is TOMICA WOOD, a sexy,
attractive black woman in her early twenties.
As Eazy watches Tomica, a slight smile crosses his face.
AT THE TERRACE BAR
Tomica watches one of her GIRLFRIENDS take a sip from her
margarita.

forgot what a good margarita tastes

Girlfriend #1 offers Tomica her glass.
TOMICA (CONT'D)
I wish I could but I'm still breastfeeding. I've got to stick to club
soda.
Tomica sips her soda and checks her watch.
TOMICA (CONT'D)
Maybe I should call the babysitter
to make sure she got him to bed okay.
GIRLFRIEND #1
Tomica, the baby's fine. Come on,
we never get to see you. Now that
you're single again maybe we can do
this more often.
GIRLFRIEND #2
We're just so glad you showed that
asshole the door. When we heard he
raised his hands to you, I swear,
sister, we almost came over there
with a baseball bat.
GIRLFRIEND #1
That's right.

Well, don't think he didn't leave
with a few bruises of his own.
Tomica smiles mischievously.

Tomica's two girlfriends LAUGH

GIRLFRIEND #2
Here's to the return of girl's night

Tomica raises her club soda and they all click their glasses.
Suddenly, a giant SHADOW falls over the bar. The girls look
up to see the hulking form of Big Ron hovering over them.
BIG RON

Eazy E would like to meet you.
TOMICA
Me?

84.
GIRLFRIEND #2
(delighted)
Eazy E? Is here? Where is he?
RON
(points across the
patio)
Right over there.
Tomica looks in the direction Big Ron is pointing in. Eazy's
posse is still crowded around him, handing out flyers.
Suddenly, Eazy pokes his head out from behind his friends
and gives Tomica a wave. He's got a pen in his hand as he
continues to sign autographs for a group of fans.
GIRLFRIEND #1
Oh my God...it really is him.
TOMICA
(to Big Ron)
Tell your friend thanks anyway.
I'm not interested.

But

Big Ron looks puzzled by this.
BIG RON
Alright.
He turns and walks away.
GIRLFRIEND #2
You don't want to meet him?
Not really.
Remember?

TOMICA
It's girl's night out.

The girls clink glasses again and start talking.
INT. NORTH HOLLYWOOD CLUB - HALLWAY - LATER
Tomica and her girlfriends are leaving the club. As her two
girlfriends move ahead of her through the crowd to the front
door, Tomica suddenly finds herself face to face with Eazy,
standing in front of her.
EAZY
What's a boy gotta do to say hello?
TOMICA
If you wanted to meet me you should
have come over and introduced
yourself.

85.
EAZY
Aw, Big Ron was just helping a brother
out. I'm Eazy E. What's your name?
TOMICA
Tomica. So Eazy E, is that the name
your mother gave you?
Eazy is disarmed by Tomica's straight-forward, matter-offact way.
EAZY
It's Eric.
Eric.

TOMICA
I like that name a lot better.

There is a short, somewhat awkward pause.
TOMICA (CONT'D)
Eric, I appreciate the introduction
and it's nice to meet you, but you'll
have to excuse me. I have a new
baby at home.
EAZY
I understand. I've got a few little
guys myself.
(hands her a flyer)
I just wanted to personally give you
an invitation to our pool party next
week.
TOMICA
That's nice, Eric, but I'm not really
a pool party type of girl. But thanks
again. Have a good night.
Tomica pushes past him through the crowd to her girlfriends
at the front door, who have been watching her exchange with
Eazy.
Eazy gives Tomica one last wave as she and her girlfriends
exit together.

You got it.
A friend of Tomica's walks by and taps her on the shoulder.
TOMICA'S FRIEND
Tomica. There's somebody over there
who wants to meet you.
Tomica looks over to where her friend is pointing. There's
a group of people she doesn't recognize...then Eazy leans
out from behind the crowd and give her a wave.
TOMICA
We've already met.
Tomica can't help but smile at Eazy's charm as he walks over
with a grin.
EAZY
Whussup?
Hello again.

TOMICA
It's Eric, right?

EAZY
That's right. You can't stop thinking
about me, can you, Tomica?
Tomica chuckles at his brazen confidence.
TOMICA
Very funny.
She sees someone across the room waving her over.

Well, Eric, it's nice to see you

Nah. I just wanted to make sure I

Eric, please, there's no reason to
call me. Honestly, you're really
not my type.
Eazy holds up a piece of PAPER with her telephone number
written on it.
EAZY
Too late. I already got your digits
from your friend.
TOMICA
I'm sorry, I really don't have time
to talk right now. And I won't have
any time to talk to you if you call

hope you understand.

INT. TABU RECORDS - CLARENCE AVANT'S OFFICE - DAY
Tomica comes strolling through the office with her purse and
some FOLDERS when she stops and looks surprised.

out of a massive CENTERPIECE. The floral arrangement is so
large that it covers most of her desk leaving her no room
left to work.
Tomica steps up and looks at the STACK of PHONE MESSAGES
sitting on her computer keyboard. As she thumbs through
them we see that most of the messages are for her from Eric.
Her gaze is drawn to a JEWELRY BOX sitting on her computer
keyboard. She picks it up and opens it. Inside is a GOLD
WATCH. There's a small handwritten NOTE that says "Since
you never have time to see me maybe this will help. Eric."
Suddenly - the PHONE RINGS on her desk and Tomica picks it
up.

Yes, Eric. They're very nice...thank

what to say. This can't go on. I
mean what do I have to do to be clear
I'm not interested in seeing you?
EAZY (O.S.)
(on phone)
Go to lunch with me.
There's a long pause as Tomica slides into her desk chair
and mulls this over.
TOMICA
One lunch. And if I agree to go
then you'll agree to stop calling?
EAZY (O.S.)
(on phone)
One lunch. And if you don't want me
to call after that, I won't call.
Tomica thinks for a moment.
TOMICA

each other's company.
EAZY (V.O.)

I got the tuner and amp. Me and Dre

Tomica looks around Eazy's new house with warm appreciation.
TOMICA
It's a beautiful place, Eric. But
how come you don't have any pictures
of your family? There's not even
any pictures here of your kids.

doorway, Eazy walks over to Jerry.
JERRY
(to Eazy)
Thanks for coming by. Bunch of things
got backed up. Just sign the ones
I've got open over there...
Jerry slides the check ledger over to Eazy and he begins to
sign the checks. It feels like a routine they've done a
hundred times. Tomica starts to look concerned as she watches
Eazy sign check after check without even a glance as to who
they're going to.
TOMICA
Eric, do you even know what you're
signing?
Jerry rolls his eyes, dismissing Tomica as just another short
term bimbo in Eazy's life. But when Eazy stops signing the
checks to examine them, Jerry turns to get a better look at
her.
JERRY
And who might you be?
TOMICA
Tomica.
JERRY
What do you do, Tomica?
TOMICA
I work for Clarence Avant over at
Motown.
Jerry isn't expecting this and it gets up his competitive
dander. Eazy seems to enjoy Tomica's ability to spar with
Jerry.

pissed as you are.
DRE
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Fuck you, bitch.

DOUG
Easy, daddy, we're gonna smooth all
this out.
Fueled with rage and Jack Daniels, Dre is getting increasingly
hostile. Doug sees it and is bracing himself to intervene.
DRE
You fucking used us like a dirty
bitch.
Dee can see that Dre is seething.
but Dre gives her a shove.
Hey!

She starts to move away

DEE
Don't touch me!

Dre takes another menacing step forward and Dee backs away.
Suddenly she stumbles, loses her balance and falls down the
stairs.
Doug Young watches in horror as Dee topples downward landing
in a heap at the bottom of the stairs.
DOUG
Oh fuck!
DOWNSTAIRS
Dee is on the floor when she looks up and sees Dre drunkenly
bounding down the stairs after her.

Weak from her fall, Dee tries to crawl over to the ladies
room but Dre blocks her way at the foyer. He grabs her by
the hair and SLAPS her twice across the face.
Doug comes running down the stairs to break it up, but Dre's
bodyguard blocks his way.
DOUG (CONT'D)
Get outta my way!
Doug shoves Dre's bodyguard hard and the bodyguard pulls out
a gun and slams him in the face. Doug goes down with blood
gushing from his mouth.
After what seems like an eternity, Dre lets Dee go and she
drops to the ground. Then Dre and his bodyguard walk quickly
through the club.
Eazy and Yella make their way to the front of the crowd to
see what's going on as Dre and his bodyguard blow by them
and out the door.

Dre is sitting close to the stage. He gulps down his Wild

A WAITRESS steps up and lays two more shots on Dre's table.
WAITRESS
A friend sent these over with his
compliments.
Dre turns around and sees Suge Knight a few tables over
getting a lap dance from another stripper. Suge sees Dre
and waves his giant paw as the stripper grinds her butt into
his groin. Dre downs one drink, grabs another and walks
over to Suge.
DRE
You following me or something?
Nah.

Suge kicks a chair over to Dre. Dre sits as the stripper

Jerry is stricken with fear. He pulls a gun out of his jacket

This isn't a street war.
He takes out a pen and scribbles something on the Billboard
magazine in front of him.
JERRY (CONT'D)
There's no way Dre can just leave
Ruthless Records. He'd have to
forfeit everything and he's too greedy
to do that.
Eazy's smoldering, not convinced.
EAZY
I'm telling you, Jerry, Suge is
gunnin' for us. We gotta take him
out of the picture.

He slides the Billboard magazine over to Eazy and points to
the BILLBOARD CHART on one of the pages.

Look at what you've accomplished.
You should be celebrating.
Eazy looks at the magazine. He sees the new NWA album

The bodyguard pats Eazy down. He reaches under Eazy's jacket
and removes a HANDGUN tucked in his waistband. Then Eazy
walks past him into the room.
INT. SOLAR RECORDING STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
The door closes behind him and Eazy stands in the empty
studio. The room is dark and murky with the only light coming
from the vu meters on the mixing board. Eazy looks at the
equipment. The fader knobs are down. The reel-to-reel decks
are empty. The soundproofing makes the room deathly quiet.
Just then - Suge steps out of the shadows. He's peeling an
orange with a gigantic hunting knife as he flashes Eazy a
wicked smile.
SUGE
Looking for somebody?
Yeah.

EAZY
I'm looking for Dre.

SUGE
Dre stepped out.
EAZY
Tell him I stopped by.
Eazy turns to leave and comes face to face with two MUSCULAR
THUGS dressed in black. It's an ambush. Thug 1 jams a
baseball bat hard into Eazy's gut, knocking the wind out of
him.
Thug 2 brings a lead pipe down over Eazy's head and pulls it
tight across his neck, yanking him upright. They hold him
there. He's unable to move, barely able to breathe.
SUGE
I need you to sign something.
EAZY
I ain't signing shit.
SUGE
You won't look very good in a
wheelchair.
As the thug tightens his chokehold, Suge slides a piece of
paper in front of Eazy with the tip of his knife.
SUGE (CONT'D)
This releases Dr. Dre from Ruthless
Records.
Eazy can only move his eyes down to look at the paper.

107.
With the pipe across his neck, he's rasping hard just to get
enough air to speak.
EAZY
You can wipe your ass with that
fuckin' release.
Suge steps in close and taps the tip of his knife on Eazy's
face.
SUGE
Shit's deeper than that, Eazy.
There's a lot to think about. We
got Jerry in a van with a gun to his
head. They're waiting for a phone
call from me to blow his brains out.
Suge reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Polaroid photo
of EAZY'S MOTHER smiling for the camera. A handwritten
address is scrawled across the bottom. He holds in front of
Eazy's face.
SUGE (CONT'D)
Then we're gonna pay a visit to
Greenleaf Avenue. Isn't that where
your mama lives? Ain't no gated
community there.
(looks at the picture)
I wonder if your folks will still be
smiling after we cut their fuckin'
heads off.
This shakes Eazy up. Suge feels like he's beaten down his
prey and moves in for the kill.
SUGE (CONT'D)
Eazy "Mutha-fuckin" E. You think
you're some bad ass, don't you?
Suge slides the release form and pen over to Eazy's hand.
Eazy studies them.

Something bad is going to go down --

EAZY (V.O.)
I could take losing Dre. I could
even take a beating from these niggas
and still have the strength to spit
in their faces. But what I couldn't
take was that I bought Dre's hustle.
There was a time I never would have
made a mistake like that. And now

Calm down. Listen to me. Dre isn't
going to be able to release that
album as long as he's under contract
with Ruthless. No one is going to
touch him.
Eazy plops down on the couch and for the first time Jerry
notices how disheveled and stoned he appears. Jerry comes
over and sits down next to him.
JERRY (CONT'D)
You're letting this thing with Dre
destroy you. We've got a great
company here. Ruthless is much bigger
than NWA. You've got all these other
groups. Bones, Thugs and Harmony
are gonna be huge. I need you to
keep it together.
Eazy is listening, but he's still in too much pain to respond.
Just then, Conny, Jerry's assistant, pokes her head in.
CONNY

Eazy walks over and plops back on the couch. Jerry steps
over to a half open closet door and takes a look inside.
The shelves are full of HANDGUNS and AUTOMATIC WEAPONS.
It's an arsenal. On the closet floor are green plastic TRASH
BAGS full of MARIJUANA.
Jerry turns and sees Eazy taking another long haul off his
bubbling bong.
JERRY (CONT'D)
What the hell do you need all this

Eazy exhales a huge pot cloud into the air and goes into a
coughing fit.
EAZY
My homies come by for a bag now and

Jerry pulls up a chair and sits across from Eazy.

For Christ sakes, Eazy. This has

Eazy waves him off as he takes another hit off his bong.

Listen to me. I'm making a deal
right now for us to co-distribute
Dre's new album with Interscope.
EAZY
What? Why the fuck should we codistribute when we own Dre's ass?
JERRY
Because it's good business. We could
fight this in court for years or we
could make this deal and get our

all and lost it all. I fucked it
all off. I made bad choices and I
came out the other end of it alone,
without a family and I had to start

thing to a son I've ever had.
Eazy looks at Jerry for a minute before shaking his head.

dozen tables of guests.
NEWSCASTER
Among the surprise guests who got to
have lunch with President Bush at
the Republican Inner Circle luncheon
today was hip-hop star Eazy E whose
appearance startled many of the
guests. The controversial rap
musician was once considered by the
FBI to be an agitator because of his
hard-hitting song about law
enforcement.

Eazy's appearance. He looks sick and in need of a shower.
Seeing Jerry there, Eazy lights up a joint and takes a deep
drag.
EAZY
What's this canceled check for $30,000

Jerry walks over and takes a look at the ledger.

You wrote that check in September,
cashed it and gave the money to one

Eazy rummages through some more canceled checks and holds up
another.

What about this one for $17,000?
What's this for?
