spiritual worship. Do not be conformedto this world, but be transformed by
the renewal of your mind,
that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, whatis good and
acceptable and perfect. -Romans 12:1-2

servants...
CHRIS :
I wasn’t gonna go there.

Page 24/94

Couldn’t bear to letthem go. I hate the way it makesus look though...
CHRIS :
Hey. People need work.
DEAN :
Yeah.
They arrive at an outdoor patio. Dean stops Chris fromstepping on a dead
sparrow.
26.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Well, crap.
(Calling)
Walter!
Walter turns to face them. He has that same eerily mild smile.
Vacant in its sincerity.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Another dead bird!
(To Chris)
Damn things fly into the patiofrom time to time; break their
necks.
Walter nods slowly. Dean gently kicks the bird’s carcass outof their way.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Iced tea?
EXT. OUTDOOR PATIO - DAY
Dean, Missy, Chris and Rose sit with iced teas.
MISSY:

CHRIS :
My Dad was never really in thepicture. My mom passed away when Iwas 11; She
was hit by a car.
MISSY DEAN :
Oh, that’s awful; so young. I’m sosorry to hear that.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Yeah. My aunt raised me, with mycousins. We didn’t have a lot of
money or anything, but she’s agood person; kept me off thestreets. She gave

camera.
Rose holds Chris’ hand.

Page 25/94

MISSY :
You two seem like you’ve beentogether for years. How long hasit been now?

MISSY :
Yep. You’re in love. I can tell.

Walter mows past them in the distance.
MISSY :
And how did you meet, again?
CHRIS :
At the blood drive.
ROSE :
Remember when I volunteered at the
community center?
DEAN :
Ah, yes.
MISSY :

Page 26/94

And he really is so good looking,
isn’t he? You’d have beautiful
babies.
ROSE :
I know!
DEAN :
Uh oh. Get out of here before it’s
too late!
28.
ROSE:
(to Chris)
Now, all you have to do is justquit smoking.
DEAN :
Oh no! A smoker!?
MISSY :
And we were just beginning to like
you.
CHRIS :
No. I’m quitting.
DEAN :
You should have Missy take care ofthat for you.
ROSE :
Oh God.
CHRIS :
How?
DEAN :
Hypnosis. Works like a charm.
Missy watches Chris’ reaction intently. He is uncomfortable.
CHRIS :
Oh.
DEAN :
I thought the whole thing was B.S.

Page 27/94

too. I smoked for 20 years. Sheputs me under once, now the sightof a
cigarette makes me wannavomit.
MISSY :
Of course, I’d give you theservice for free. You are familyafter all.
CHRIS :
Wow. I don’t... Thank you. Um, Idon’t know.
Chris looks to Rose for help.
ROSE :
You guys, normal people don’t wantstrangers fiddling around in theirheads.
29.
MISSY :
If you change your mind... We’rejust glad you could join us forthe big
get-together.
Georgina brings the pitcher of iced tea around and refillseveryone’s glass.
Chris tries to thank her with a look. Shesmiles and avoids eye contact.
CHRIS :

ROSE :
The party tomorrow? I told you.
CHRIS :
I must have forgot.
MISSY :
Oh, well we host a shindig once ayear for our friends.

Some just friends...
MISSY :
Drinks, good food, good people...
CHRIS :

Georgina has been pouring Chris’ drink too long and his glasshas overflown.
MISSY :

Page 28/94

Georgina!
Georgina snaps out of her daze. She realizes what she’s doneand starts to
clean.
MISSY (CONT’D)
It’s fine George, I’ll get it.
Maybe you need a nap.
Georgina nods, smiles and walks away. Chris and Rose look atDean. That was
odd. Dean shrugs.
A CAR HORN HONKS in front of the house.
DEAN :
Jeremy’s home.
JEREMY, 29, rounds the house with open arms.
30.
He’s “Rich kid intense”; handsome and strong with anunpredictable wildness
behind his eyes.
JEREMY :
Who answers the door around here?!
INT. ARMITAGE DINING ROOM - LATER/NIGHT
Everyone laughs.
Dean pours the remainder of a bottle of wine into Chris’glass. Their meal
is done and they are tipsy. Jeremy pops thecork on a new bottle of wine as
he energetically holds court.
JEREMY :

Jeremy demonstrates and Chris winces.

Page 30/94

CHRIS :

ROSE :
He cornered me and shoved his
tongue in my mouth, so yeah.
CHRIS :

MISSY :

(to Dean)
Maybe we can change theconversation to something a littlelighter.
32.
ROSE :
Yeah, great story. Thanks formaking it totally uncomfortable.
Missy walks out of the dining room into the kitchen. The doorswings open
and Chris gets another glimpse of Georgina whostands with a kitchen knife
and wears an intense and wicked

JEREMY :

CHRIS :

The kitchen door swings open again, and Missy walks back inwith a perfect
carrot cake. Georgina is gone.
MISSY :
What’d I miss?
ROSE :
More ramblings from King Awkward.
JEREMY :
We’re talking about sports.
(To Chris)

MISSY :

JEREMY :

JEREMY :

EXT. THE ESTATE. NIGHT
Full moon. CRICKETS.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Rose and Chris make hushed love in her bed. A stuffed lion
seems to watch Chris. He turns it away.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - LATER
Rose sleeps, but Chris is wide awake. There’s a buzz in hisear. He smacks
his own head and sits up. A soft HOWL of WINDrushes through the room. The
CLOSET DOOR CREEKS open.
Chris’ eyes drift to the pack of cigarettes sticking out ofhis camera bag
pocket draped on the desk chair.

upstairs. He stops and turns, expectingsomeone to follow him down. Nothing.
Chris continues to walkdown the hallway past the pictures towards the
kitchen.
The basement door is open a crack. Chris peers into itcuriously. A

Chris steps out the back door and takes a cigarette out. Chrislooks into
the vast night around him. The CRICKETS aredeafening.
Suddenly, something DARTS FAST across the yard in thedistance. Chris peers
out into the darkness. The thing RUNSacross the lawn again. A moment of
terror comes over Chris. Hemakes out a shape. It’s now running towards him.
Chris backsup in fear just as the figure emerges from the shadows andinto
the moonlight. It’s Walter, the grounds keeper. He passesChris without
noticing. Chris gathers his breath.
The kitchen light turns on and floods the backyard. Chrisdrops the
cigarette and stomps it out. He turns back towardsthe house and finds
himself face to face with Georgina, whoglares through the window dead in
Chris’ eyes. He’s caught.
Georgina doesn’t react. Chris it still. Georgina suddenlyexposes her teeth
in a frightening grimace. Chris backs awayslowly.
INT. ARMITAGE KITCHEN - NIGHT

looking at her teeth in the reflection in thewindow which, front lit,
reflects her and the room around her.
Outside is invisible.

Terror. Chris, 26 again, breathes fast but falls in slowmotion though
darkness as if through water.
TING TING. TING TING.
He flails towards a pitch black abyss. He’s illuminated by the

above him. It shows what his eyes are seeing.
CHRIS :
No! NO!!! I’m done! Bring me back!
Please!!!!
There is no response. Chris cries. Eventually he slows downand comes to a
stop. He lands feet first on a soft ground.
This place sounds like it’s crawling with insects. He looksup. He can still
see the screen above but it is far away, likethe mouth of a deep and
expansive well.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Mrs. Armitage!!!
On the screen, Missy stands. She walks towards Chris’ body andlooks down at
him through his own eyes.
MISSY :
Now you are in the Sunken Place.
Missy reaches towards the screen and shuts his eyelids. Theabyss goes
almost completely dark. Now he’s alone in the dark.
He cries in terror.
Chris hears a DEEP HULKING BREATHING in the darkness.
CHRIS :

Bring me back.
The sounds get louder and louder.
THUNK THUNK. THUNK THUNK.

An antlered thing emerges from the shadow. It’s head is thatof a deer, but
with the flesh stripped off and with mostly itsskull exposed.
CHRIS (CONT’D)

Sid’s mouth. Chris smiles. The batteries are low.
He plugs his phone in and puts it on the dresser.
EXT. BACKYARD - DAWN
It’s Golden hour. Beautiful. Chris walks through the yard tothe edge of the
forest with his camera.
Chris keeps walking. He looks through a long-zoom lens intothe wilderness.
He sees a bird and snaps a picture.
He turns to the house. Georgina can be seen through anupstairs window
knitting. He raises his camera. She’sbeautiful. She stands and begins to
remove her wig. Then as ifaware she’s being watched, she turns towards him.
Chris turnsaway, taking a picture in another direction. He glances backat
the window. Georgina is gone.

CHRIS :
Ha!
Walter isn’t joking.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. Inever really got to meet youactually, up
close. I’m Chris.
WALTER :

Chris raises his hand in a timid ‘black power fist.’ Walterraises his hand
in an open wave.
CHRIS :

ROSE :
The nightmares. When I was a kid.
She hypnotized me once for stagefright, and I had the craziestnightmares,
but it worked...
She wraps herself up in Chris’ arms. Chris thinks.
CHRIS :
And, what’s the deal with the
help?
ROSE :

CHRIS :
Right. I meanPARKER :
The world cares, April. But it’snot a question of physicalsuperiority, it’s
“What skin coloris more culturally advantageous?”
As Parker drones on Chris looks around the party. Deanschmoozes animatedly
with two couples. He quickly scans theparty, finds Chris and points him
out. The two couples waveand smile giddily. They had all just been talking
about him.
Chris pretends to not see this.

Page 47/94

ROSE :
“Advantageous?”
Suddenly, Chris sees another black guy walking through thecrowd. Relief. It
is Andre, the jogger from the first scene,
but he’s very different than before.
50.
He seems glazed-over with the same frozen smile as Walter andGeorgina, and
wears a particularly square ascot and golfinghat.
PARKER :
Fairer skin is has been in favor’
the last couple of thousands ofyears, but the pendulum has swungback again
hasn't it..?
CHRIS :
I’m sorry. I’m going to getanother drink.
Chris walks away.
PARKER :
I didn’t mean to offend him.
ROSE :
Really? ‘Cause you have yet to sayanything that’s not a blanketstatement
about race.
PARKER :
Now, Rose.EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
Andre stands by the bar and makes himself a Martini. Chrisapproaches him.
CHRIS :
It’s good to see another brotheraround here.
Andre turns to face Chris neatly. Andre’s voice is completelydifferent from
the first scene. There is no longer any traceof an urban dialect. He speaks
in a lower pitch and slow,
enunciating his words precisely.
ANDRE :
Yes, of course it is.
Chris expects Andre to engage more. He doesn’t. He just staresat him
smiling.
CHRIS :
Who do you know?

Page 48/94

ANDRE :
Why, the Armitage’s of course.
We’re friends of the family.
51.
PHIL, 65, a craggy effeminate man with manicured eyebrows,
cuts between them.
PHIL:
(to Andre)
There you are. Here, put thissomewhere.
Phil hands his napkin to Andre who pockets it obediently. Philplaces his
hand on Andre’s back possessively.
PHIL (CONT'D)
(to Chris)
Oh, hello. I’m Phil... and youare...?
CHRIS :
Chris. Rose’s boyfriend.
PHIL :
Fantastic. Logan and I know Rosevery well.
ANDRE :
I’m sorry, where are my manners.
Logan, Logan King.
(To Phil)
Chris was just telling me that hefelt more comfortable with mybeing here.
Chris is let down. Andre isn’t what he had hoped.
PHIL :
That’s nice. Logan, I hate to tearyou away, dear, but the Wincott’swere
asking about you.
ANDRE/LOGANAh, well it was nice meeting youChris.
CHRIS :
Sure.
Chris holds out his fist for Andre/Logan to bump. Andre/Loganshakes Chris’
fist and then, realizing his error fist bumpshim like it’s the first time.
Andre/Logan and Phil laugh and walk away. They join a smallgroup of people
who applaud Andre’s arrival. Andre does alittle spin showing off his
clothes.
52.
EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Page 49/94

Chris comes back to Rose. He is more creeped out and agitated.
ROSE :
Where’s your drink?
CHRIS :
What? Oh, I forgot.
Dean projects over the crowd.
DEAN :
Hello!
Everyone applauds and gives Dean their attention.
DEAN (CONT'D)
Achem! Once again, I want to thank
you all for coming. Words cannot
express how much it means to us
that after all these years we can
all still get together and share.
I’m reminded of stories of how the
knights of old would gather in
honor of a new crusade...
EXT. GAZEBO. DAY.
During Dean’s speech, Chris wanders away from the group.
JIM :
Ignorant shit...
Chris hadn’t seen Jim Hudson, the blind man, who sits in the
gazebo with his seeing eye dog. He is close to Chris, but farenough away
from the group that no one else hears them.
CHRIS :
Who?
JIM:
All of them. Ignorant assholes.
They have no idea what real people
go through.
CHRIS:
I guess people only see what’s in
front of them.
Chris notices his faux pas.
53.
CHRIS (CONT’D)

Page 50/94

I mean...
JIM :
Heh. No, you’re right. And usuallynot even that much. That’s people.
Jim holds a glass up. Chris fist bumps the glass.
JIM (CONT’D)
Jim Hudson.
CHRIS :
ChrisJIM :
I know who you are. I’m an admirerof your work; you have a great
eye...
CHRIS :
Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson
Galleries?
Jim smiles.
JIM :
The irony of being a blind artdealer isn’t lost on me.
CHRIS :
How do you do it?
JIM :
I have an assistant describe work
to me. You’ve got something... Theimages you capture... so
brutallymelancholic. Powerful stuff.
CHRIS :
Thank you. Yeah, I just likefinding the beauty in abandonedthings.
JIM :
I used to dabble myself.
Wilderness mostly. I submitted toNat Geo 14 times before realizingI didn’t
have “the eye” for it;
Began dealing. And then, ofcourse, my vision went to shit.
CHRIS :
Damn.
54.

Page 51/94

JIM :
I know. Life can be a sick joke.
One day you're working in a darkroom, and the next day - BAM. Youwake up in
the dark. Geneticdisease.
CHRIS :
Shit ain’t fair, man.
JIM :
Yeah.
Jeremy comes over with his preppy friend, Derrick, 29.
JEREMY :
Chris, we need you...
CHRIS :
Yeah, sure.
(to Jim)
Nice to meet you.
JIM :
Stop by the gallery some time.
Bout time you had a solo show.
CHRIS :
Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. Thatwould be a game changer.
JIM :
I think we could do wonderful
things together.
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER
Chris and Rose play badminton against Jeremy and Derrick. Agaggle of party
guests watch, entertained. Chris is actuallyhaving fun. He swings big but
misses the shuttlecock.
JEREMY :
HA! Come on. You can do better
than that!
CHRIS :
Not my game, what can I say.
JEREMY :
Yeah, I see that.

Page 52/94

ROSE :
Shut up Jeremy.
55.
JEREMY :
I’m just saying, if your boy isn’tgonna bring his ‘A’ game, we mightas well
bring Mom up here.
CHRIS :
Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin’smack huh?
Chris serves the shuttlecock hard. The following rally islong, captivating
the crowd. Chris ends it with an impressivediving swat. Derrick misses the
return and the crowd goeswild. Chris throws his arms up in celebration.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Boom!
ROSE :
Yay, baby!
JEREMY :
See, that’s what I’m talkingabout!!! Okay, again!
Chris is about to serve. He scans the crowd of beaming faces.
Everyone is rooting for Chris. They love him. Chris scans thecrowd. It’s
too much.
CHRIS :
Hold up. Here.
ROSE :
Where are youCHRIS :
I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
Chris gives his racket to Gordon Greene.
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Chris walks through the kitchen.
INT. ARMITAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY
Chris slips past several small groups of guests mingling. Hegoes up the
stairs to the second floor.
As soon as he are out of sight and earshot, the minglingguests stop in
mid-conversation. Everyone in the room waitsand listens to CHRIS’ FOOTSTEPS
above.
It is now clear that their conversations have been fake. Theyare all

Page 53/94

hanging on Chris’ actions.
56.
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Chris walks to Rose’ room.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - DAY
Chris exits the bathroom in Rose’s room. The bed is made. He
picks his phone up from the dresser. It’s unplugged and out ofbatteries.
That’s odd. He plugs it in again as he hears aCREAK down the hall.
INT. ARMITAGE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY
Chris leaves Rose’s room. A door at the end of the hallway isa crack open.
Chris slowly walks down the hall, and peersinside. A couple lacrosse
trophies and one for ju-jitsu.
Jeremy’s room. Movement inside. It’s Georgina making the bed.
The door creaks alerting her of his presence, she turnsslowly. Before she
sees him he walks quickly back to Rose’sroom just as she comes upstairs.
ROSE :
Hey! You okay?
Chris waves for her to join him back in her room.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - DAY
Chris speaks quietly and frantically to Rose.
CHRIS :
The housekeeper unplugged myphone.
Rose sighs. “Not this again.”
CHRIS (CONT’D)
I’m trying to check in with Rod,
and I got no juice.
ROSE :
I’m sure it was an honest mistake.
CHRIS :
Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe shedoesn’t like the fact that I’m
with you.
ROSE :
Chris...
57.
CHRIS :
What? It’s a thing.
ROSE :

Page 54/94

You think my family’s housekeepergives a shit who you’re with?
That’s crazy bae.
Chris sits on the bed and rubs his forehead.
CHRIS :
Forget it. Nevermind.
ROSE :
Look, I get it. This whole thingis stressful. I mean, they’recircling you
like hyenas downthere. I just don’t get why you’retaking it out on George

CHRIS:

You’re right. I’m being paranoid.
I just need a minute and I’ll bedown.
ROSE :
Fine.
Rose leaves a little annoyed.

CHRIS :

Chris hangs up and brings his phone with him. He opens thedoor. Georgina
stands right outside it, eerie smile and all.
Chris is startled.
GEORGINA :
Hello.
CHRIS :
Hi.
Georgina’s voice is shaky and careful.
GEORGINA :
I owe you an apology. I shouldn’tbe touching things that don’tbelong to me.
CHRIS :
Oh, no. It’s cool. I was justconfused.
GEORGINA :
I lifted your cellular phone thismorning to wipe down the dresserand it
accidentally came undone,
see?
CHRIS :
Yeah, IGEORGINA :
Rather than meddle with it
further, I left it that way.
61.
CHRIS :
Really, it’s okay. I didn’t mean

Page 58/94

to rat you out.
Georgina eyes get lost for a moment. There’s a pain behind hersmile.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
...get you in trouble.
GEORGINA :
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no...
Aren’t you the sweetest thing? Notat all. The Armitages are so goodto us;
They treat us like family.
EXT. BACKYARD - AFTERNOON
Chris walks back into the back yard where Dean entertainsseven people Chris
hasn’t met. They turn as Chris approachessmiling eagerly. They all seem to
share a private joke.
DEAN :
Chris! There you are. I wanted tointroduce you to some old friends.
We’ll do it quickly. Down theline: David and Marcia Wincott,
Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki
Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika
Walden.
Each couple - DAVID and MARCIA, RONALD and CELIA, HIROKI,
FREDRICH and JESSIKA - waves as they are named.
CHRIS :
Too many names to remember but...
The couples all laugh nervously.
HIROKI :
(to Dean in Japanese)
Can we ask him questions?
DEAN :
(Japanese)
Of course.
HIROKI :
Do you find that being AfricanAmerican has more advantages ordisadvantages
in the modern world?
Chris pans the crowd who all give him their undividedattention. The silence
is long. Chris sighs. He looks forRose. She is off talking to someone.
62.
CHRIS :
Yeah, I don’t know, man.

Page 59/94

They all smile like hungry vampires. Chris is veryuncomfortable with this
unprovoked group interrogation. Andre/
Logan and Phil approach.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
That’s actually a great question.
Logan! They were asking me aboutthe African American experience.
Maybe you could take this one.
Andre/Logan is a little caught off guard but dives in.
ANDRE/LOGANMy life as an African American hasbeen, for the most part,
verygood. It’s hard to be too specificas I haven’t much desired to leave
the house in a while.
The crowd chuckles. Chris takes out his phone.
PHIL :
We’ve become homebodies...
ANDRE/LOGAN
(To Phil)
But recently, even when you go tothe city, I’ve just had nointerest.
(To the group)
The chores are my sanctuWith the attention on Andre/Logan, Chris subtly backs awayfrom the
conversation. He raises his phone toward Andre/Loganand the group and snaps
a picture. The FLASH POPS.
CHRIS :
Shit.
Everyone turns to Chris. Andre/Logan steps forward and looksat Chris oddly;
His head cocks a little and his peacefulexpression drifts slowly to
maddened horror. Some of the party
guests gasp.
PHIL :
Logan?
Andre/Logan drops his glass and stumbles towards Chris. Chrisbacks up, but
Andre is already up in his space.
63.
ANDRE :
Get out.
Andre/Logan’s voice is higher and scratchy, like it was in thefirst scene.
CHRIS :
Hey, man, I’m sorry, IAndre/Logan grabs Chris by the shoulders and screams shrilly.

Page 60/94

Blood trickles out of his nose.
ANDRE :
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!
Phil and Jeremy grab Andre. They have to pry Andre/Logan’sgrip off of
Chris. When they do Andre/Logan screamsbloodcurdlingly. It takes all their
strength to bring him intothe house. Missy and Dean follow.
INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON
Rose sits on the couch. She’s been crying. Chris comforts herbut is clearly
traumatised. A few other concerned guests millaround. Dean enters everyone
gives him their attention.
ROSE :
What the Hell was that?
DEAN :
It was a seizure.
ROSE :
A seizure?
DEAN :
Yes. Logan’s okay. Missy’s withhim now. Are you okay Chris?
CHRIS :
Yeah. Why did he come at me likethat?
ROSE :
Yeah seizures don’t make peopleattack people, I’m sorry.
DEAN :
It was an abnormal manifestation
but yes, actually, sometimes theydo. The flash on your phone musthave
triggered it.
Andre/Logan enters with stands with Missy and Phil to asmattering of
concerned applause.
64.
He addresses a group in his lower pitched “Logan” voice.
ANDRE/LOGANWell, I do believe I owe you allan apology.
The group grumbles.
MISSY :
We’re just glad you’re feelingyourself again.
ANDRE/LOGANWell yes I am. It’s quite likebeing trapped in a dark room

Page 61/94

andwatching my experiences through awindow. Thank God you and Deanwere here
to calm me down.
DEAN :
It’s a simple glitch of the brain.
Nothing to be afraid of.
ANDRE/LOGANI know I scared you all quite abit.. especially you Chris.
CHRIS :
No, I’m sorry about the flash. Ididn’t know.
ANDRE/LOGANOf course. How could you have?
PHIL:
(to Andre/Logan)
You shouldn’t have been drinkingeither.
The group chuckles.
ANDRE/LOGANAs I said I’m feeling much betternow, but you’ll all have
toproceed without the aid of mymarvellous wit; the whole thinghas left me a
quite a bitexhausted.
DEAN :
Of course.
ANDRE/LOGANIt was nice meeting you.
65.
CHRIS :
Yeah, you too.
Chris is skeptical. Missy shows Phil and Logan out. Andre andPhil leave.
DEAN :
Let’s do sparklers shall we?
Brighten the mood?
He gives Chris and Rose sparklers and to other people wholight them.
ROSE :
Let’s go.
Rose takes Chris’ hand.
MISSY :
Anybody need a drink?
ROSE :
We’re going on a walk.
Rose grabs Chris’ hand and leads him out the front door. Theparty guests in

Page 62/94

the living room, Dean and Missy included, gosilent. As their sparklers burn
they approach the window,
watching Rose and Chris leave the front yard.
EXT. LAKESIDE - AFTERNOON
Rose and Chris walk by the lake. Their sparklers fizzle.
CHRIS :
My cousin is epileptic. Thatwasn’t a seizure.
ROSE :
Honestly? That was one of thestrangest things I’ve ever seen inmy life.
CHRIS :
Also, this is gonna sound weird,
but when he got up in my face likethat, I got the feeling like Iknew that
guy.
66.
EXT. BACK YARD. SAME TIME
With Chris and Rose are away, the party guests have allgathered in the back
yard facing Dean who stands by a largepicture of Chris on an easel.
Everyone is silent.
Dean raises his hand and makes numbers with his fingers:
“Three and three.” Several party guests raise their hands.
Dean points to the Waldens.
This is an auction.
EXT. LAKESIDE - SAME TIME
CHRIS :
Let’s go back home tonight.
ROSE :
What? Wait, no.
CHRIS :
I’m just... Something doesn’t feelright.
ROSE :
You mean with us?
CHRIS :
No. With this whole situation! I
just... I can’t explain but I needyou to trust me. Let’s just go. Itdoesn’t
even have to be a bigdeal.

Page 63/94

ROSE :
It is a big deal. It’s my family.
I wouldn’t even know what to tell
them.
INT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME
Dean raises his hand again making more numbers with hisfingers: “4, 5.”
Gordon Greene raises his hand. Dean points to him acceptinghis bid.
67.
EXT. LAKESIDE - SAME TIME
ROSE :
Yes, it’s weird. There are a lot
of ways I wish this was goingdifferent. I wish my brotherwasn’t a cock. I
wish my parentsfriends were chill; but justbecause it’s tough, it doesn’t
mean you run away...
Rose cries.
CHRIS :
Baby, IROSE :
...I’m late.
CHRIS :
Late?
ROSE :
I should’ve got my period likelast week.
CHRIS :
Oh.
ROSE :
I mean, I did change my birthcontrol, so it could just be that,
but...
Chris thinks silently.
ROSE (CONT’D)
So...?
CHRIS :
I don’t know what to say.
ROSE :
Okay... Try any emotional responsewhatsoever.

Page 64/94

He’s silent. Rose wipes her tears.
ROSE (CONT’D)
If you wanna go then go. I’m notgoing to force you to stay but I’mnot
leaving.
68.
EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME
The auction is flying now. Dean’s hand signals are going fast.
It’s down to three couples.
Dean signals “5, 6.” Mr. Greene raises his hand. Dean points.
Dean signals “5, 8.” Mrs. Deets raises her hand. Dean points.
Dean signals “6.” Jim Hudson raises both his hands and signals“10.” His
chauffeur stands beside him whispering in his ear.
Dean points at him.
Dean scans the crowd signalling “10, 2?” “10, 2?” The crowdlooks around. No
one is challenging. Dean smiles. Finally Deanbangs his fist onto his open
palm and points to Jim Hudson.
Jim’s chauffeur whispers in his ear.
The guests clap in a mixture of delight and disappointment.
EXT. LAKESIDE - DUSK
Chris and Rose sit watching the sunset over the lake. Chriskisses her hand.
He hears the faint APPLAUSE in the distance.
He looks in the direction of the house.
CHRIS :
I told you about the night my momdied. How I didn’t call 911;
didn’t go out looking for her.
ROSE :
BabyCHRIS :
One hour went by, then two,
three... I just sat there... Ijust watched TV.
ROSE :
It wasn’t your faultCHRIS :
I found out later she had survived
the initial hit.
CHRIS (CONT'D)
She laid there bleeding by theside of the road all night, coldand alone.
And that’s how she died
in the early morning... Cold andalone. And I was watching TV.

CHRIS (CONT’D)
There was time. If someone was
looking for her, there was time.
But no one was looking.
Chris cries. Rose embraces him.
ROSE :
You were just a kid.
CHRIS :
Yeah... yeah. So, I’m not gonnaleave here without you. I‘m notgoing to
abandon you. Never.
They share a moment of pure love.
ROSE :

ROSE :
Yeah. I mean, you’re right. Thissucks. I’ll go back with you. I’llmake

CHRIS :
I love you.
ROSE :
I love you too.
The two get up and walk back toward the house.
EXT. FRONT LAWN - DUSK
Chris and Rose approach the house as the last of the guestsget into their
cars and drive off. The fireflies are out.
CHRIS :
That was fast.
ROSE :
Yeah.
The guests wave to Dean and Missy, who stand at the frontdoor, and then to
Chris and Rose. Lisa Deets, the trophy wife,
is tipsy. Nelson is in their car.

Page 66/94

70.
LISA :
Bye Chris! It was a pleasuremeeting you. I hope youChris and Rose wave.
NELSON :
Come on, Lisa. Before you saysomething stupid.
Chris laughs. Walter shuts the car door behind Lisa. Walterstands
pleasantly watching the cars leave. He turns to Chriswith the same ‘ol
smile. Chris and Rose enter the house.
INT. ARMITAGE BATHROOM - DUSK
Sink running. Chris washes his hands and looks in the mirror.
His phone SIGNALS a text message from Rod. It’s picture fromthe internet of
witches in a circle around a man beingsacrificed followed by the text
message. “You dead yet?” Christexts back. “Bruh, you have no idea.” He
finds the picture hetook of Logan/Andre on his phone and sends it.
Moments later, his phone vibrates.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. CHRIS’ APARTMENT - DUSK
Rod is on the phone.
ROD :
That’s Dre.

The phone goes dead. No batteries.
INT. ROSE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Chris’ phone lays on the dresser plugged in. He’s in a hurrynow. He packs
his small bag and looks out the window. One carremains parked in the
designated parking area. It’s the firstto have arrived for the party: Jim
Hudson’s. The driver bringsthe dog to the back seat. He gets a green
envelope from theglove compartment and brings it to Missy at the front
door.
She accepts it silently.
The driver drives away without Jim.
Chris goes to leave Rose’s room. Her closet creaks open. Chrissees a framed
picture of Rose inside. Not quite knowing whathe’s looking for, he goes to
the closet. The picture is afrightening one. Rose is one of the witches in
a high schoolproduction of Macbeth. It’s on top of a red shoebox that
hasthe drama/comedy masks drawn on top of it.
He takes it off of the shelf. Inside is a pile of pictures. Ontop is one of
Rose dressed as Juliet in a high school play.
72.
The next one is of Rose at 13 playing Ms. Hannigan in Annie.

Page 68/94

Chris flips through a few more pictures of Rose at differentages in
different class plays.
Finally Chris comes upon a photo printed from a computer. It’sa selfie of
her and some other black guy. The picture isalmost identical to the one she
took with Chris before the
ride up. Under the image are written the words. “X-mas 2014”
Stunned, Chris flips to the next picture. It’s anotherromantic selfie, this
time with a different black guy.
Underneath, the caption “Memorial Day 2013”
He continues flipping through the stack of pictures of Rosewith 8 different
black guys. The last one is a picture of Rosewith Walter. In it she kisses
Walter’s cheek intimately.
“Thanksgiving 2009” Walter looks different in the picture. Heisn’t smiling
vaguely; he’s got swagger.
ROSE :
(emotionless)
What are you doing?
Rose stands there in the doorway behind him. Chris subtlydrops the pictures
back in the shoebox.
CHRIS :
Um... Looking for my camera.
Rose points to her desk. He grabs his bag and the camera.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Where are the keys..? I gotta putour bags in the trunk.
ROSE :
Walter can do that.
CHRIS :
Nah, I’ll do it.
Rose is truly distant for the first time. A different person.
She is methodical and emotionless. The jig is up, and now sheis now phoning
it in.
ROSE :
I was just looking for them. I’msuch a mess, will you help me?
Chris walks out the door, leaving Rose.
73.
INT. FOYER/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rose follows Chris down the stairs.
ROSE :

CHRIS :
Nothing.
Jeremy stands near the front door twirling his lacrosse stick.
Dean and Missy sit in the living room.
JEREMY :
Where are you going? The party’sjust getting started.
CHRIS :
I’m going to the car; see if weleft the keys in there.
MISSY :
I just made tea.
CHRIS :
I’m good.
The family is silent. Missy’s glare pierces Chris. He avoids
eye contact.
ROSE :
Oh, I know where they are. In mybag. Duh.
MISSY :
You’re leaving us.
CHRIS :
Yeah.
MISSY :
Is something wrong?
CHRIS :
No. Well, yeah... Um.
ROSE:

His dog is not well. He needs togo to the vet first thing in the

DEAN :
What is your purpose, Chris?
CHRIS :
What?
DEAN :
In life? What is your purpose..?
CHRIS :
Right now, it’s finding the keys.
DEAN:
We’ve been looking for our purpose
for such a long time. Fire has
mesmerized man since the Stone
Age. It is a reflection of our
impermanence in the world. Fire is
born, it breathes and then it
dies.
CHRIS :
Rose...
Rose lamely rummages through her bag.
ROSE :
I’m looking.
CHRIS :
Rose, what is this shit?!
DEAN:
There’s a reason we worship the
Sun, Chris. He who lights the way
through the darkness of life. He
in all his glory was around long
before us and will be here long
after we are gone, but he too will
die some day! That’s right even
the Sun God will die. It is no
less mortal than we, but it
inspires us to defy it! So what do
we do?-

CHRIS :
--Rose.DEAN:
(unhinged)
--What do we do?! We baptize
ourselves in the firewater!

DEAN (CONT’D)
We bathe in his reflection, for
one chance to emerge having defieddeath!
DEAN (CONT'D)
You’d take that baptism wouldn’tyou, Chris? The baptism ofimmortality?
CHRIS :
I was raised Episcopalian.
Chris starts toward the door, but his path is blocked byJeremy swinging at
air.
JEREMY :
Whoa! Be careful, bro.
MISSY :
Don’t hurt him, Jeremy.
JEREMY :
What? I’m not doing anything.
DEAN :
Listen, ChrisCHRIS :
--I don’t know what you’re saying!
DEAN :
(Through tears of joyousmadness)
I’m saying that we’ve found OURPURPOSE!!! There must be a
sacrifice! Sacrifice is essential
for the righteous to achieve ourtrue potential. A vessel must becomprised.
A host must be born!!!
CHRIS :

Page 72/94

Rose! The keys!!!
Rose backs away.
ROSE :
Oh baby... You know I can’t giveyou the keys.
Chris makes a run for the door. Missy CLINKS the cup with herSPOON.
TING TING. TING TING.
76.
The world instantly blurs around Chris. He begins to fall. Hesees a flash.
INT. DARKNESS
Chris falls through the abyss towards ‘The Sunken Place’ againjust like
when he was hypnotized. The blue screen above himshows what his open eyes
see. It’s his own perspective fallingto the floor. CRASH! The screen now
shows the living roomceiling. Jeremy leans over him.
JEREMY :
Oh shit!
MISSY (O.S.)
Is he hurt?
CHRIS :
What the fuck?
JEREMY :
Did you see him drop?
DEAN (O.S.)
He hit his head pretty good.
ROSE (O.S.)
It’s just a bump. He’s fine.
CHRIS :
Rose!!!
MISSY (O.S.)
Why do you push them, Dean?
DEAN (O.S.)
It’s important to me that theyacknowledge the purpose.
MISSY (O.S.)
Why do you think he ran?
JEREMY (O.S.)
Rose gave it away.
ROSE (O.S.)
He already knew.
MISSY (O.S.)
Take him to the games room.

Page 73/94

Jeremy, get the legs. Dean, helphim.
77.
JEREMY :
I can take him alone.
MISSY (O.S.)
No. We’ve already damaged himenough. Dean, please.
Chris continues to fall slowly further from the screen abovewhich continues
to show his body’s POV as it is being liftedby Dean and Jeremy and carried
out of the room.
CHRIS :
Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit,
shit...
DEAN :
You’re going to drop him.
JEREMY :
No I’m not.
MISSY (O.S.)
Be careful what you say, everyone.
He can hear every word.
CHRIS :
Rose!!!!
ROSE (O.S.)
It doesn’t matter any more doesit?
A DOOR CREAKS open. Chris’ body is taken downstairs into thedarkness. The
screen in the abyss goes dark.
CHRIS :
No!! Help!!! Help!!!!! Help!!!!!!
Chris sinks, his screams are enveloped by the pitch back.

Chris wakes up with a bump on his head. In front of Chris, adeer’s head is
mounted above an old-school floor-standingtelevision. Behind him, a goat’s
head is mounted under ataxidermy owl, wings spread.
His arms and legs fastened to a leather upholstered chair inthe middle of a
small dark room full of board games.
Chris pulls at the straps that bind his arms and legs.
CHRIS :

Chris tries to gnaw at the harnesses, but they are too thick.
CHRIS (CONT’D)
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh fuck. Oh

The television screen turns on. Chris watches intently. Theimage of deer
walking through woods comes on. The words
“YOU’VE GOT A FRIEND by James Taylor” comes up as the songstarts to PLAY.
It’s a forest-themed karaoke video.
Chris is confused. He tries to slip out of the binds againdrawing blood on
his wrists.
INT. CHRIS’ LIVING ROOM - DAWN
Sid wakes Rod up with a lick to the face. He’s on the sofa.
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY
Rod sits at a desk with Sid on his lap.. DETECTIVE LATOYA 50,

She speaks to someone outside her office.

DETECTIVE LATOYA
Your son is missing?
ROD :
No, sorry, not my son, my boy.
He’s my friend. He’s 26. His nameis Chris... Washington...
He gives her time to write the name which she doesn’t do. Shejust stares at

ROD (CONT’D)
He left town on Friday with hisgirlfriend Rose... Armitage...
She’s white.

ROD :
Chris was set to come back home on
Sunday. I was watching his dogSid.
Latoya points to Sid
DETECTIVE LATOYA
That’s Sid.

ROD :
Yup. Cute right? Now look...
Rod takes out his phone and scrolls to a photo of Andre.
ROD (CONT’D)
Chris sent me this which he took
at the girlfriend's parents house.
That’s Andre Hayworth, a guy weknew from back in the day. Come tofind out
he went missing 6 monthsago in an affluent suburb upstate.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Don’t look too missing to me.
ROD :
Well that’s the thing. We foundhim and now, according to Chris,
he’s gay with a differentpersonality.
82.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Gay?
ROD :
But he didn’t used to be.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
I think he might just argue with
you on that one.
ROD:
I know what I’m about to say is
gonna sound crazy.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Try me.
ROD:
You ready for this...? I think
this family is abducting black
people and brainwashing them to
work for them as sex slaves and
shit... Sorry.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
...Brainwashing?
ROD :
Yeah.
DETECTIVE LATOYA
Hold on one second.

I want you to tell these officers
exactly what you just told me.
INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER
Two detectives, Garcia, 37, and Drake, 43, stand behind
Latoya.
ROD:
...See, I don’t know if the
hypnosis makes you a slave or if
just turns you gay or what, but
they already got two brothers that
we know of, and who knows how many
more there could be.
The officers are all riveted... Then... All three detectives
laugh. Rod is not being taken the slightest bit seriously.
83.
LATOYA:

So, I don’t want none of yousayin’ I don’t do nothin’ foryou... White

They laugh even harder.

INT. CHRIS’ LOFT - DUSK
Rod sits by the window with Sid. He looks out over rooftopsand thinks. He
picks up his phone and calls Chris again. Heknows Chris won’t answer. ThenROSE :
Hello?
Rod is taken off guard. He almost drops his phone.

Chris?
ROD :
Yo. Um, Rose? It’s Rod.
ROSE :
Hi.
ROD :
Where’s Chris?
INTERCUT WITH:
84.
INT. ARMITAGE HOUSE. DINING ROOM - DUSK
Rose stands by the dining table on Chris’ phone. Rose starts
to cry.
ROSE :
He left like two days ago.
ROD :
He left?
ROSE :
We got in a fight. He got allparanoid and flipped out; He tooka cab home.
He forgot his phone.
Wait... You haven’t seen him?
ROD :
No. He never made it back here.
ROSE :
Oh my God.
ROD :
I’ve been calling. I went to thepolice and everything.
Rose is silent.
ROD (CONT’D)
Hello?
ROSE :
What did you say?
ROD :

Page 80/94

I told them he was missing.
ROSE :
Uh huh...
ROD :
So... What cab company did he use?
ROSE :
I don’t know. A local one I’m
guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I’m soconfused...
ROD :
Hold on a second.
Rod knows she had something to do with it.
85.
He opens up ‘Garage Band’ on Chris’ computer and puts thephone on speaker,
recording her.
ROD (CONT’D)
So, last time Chris and I talked,
he told me your mom hypnotizedhim?
Rose is silent. Then...
ROSE :
Rod, just stop.
ROD :
Huh?
ROSE :
I know why you’re calling.
ROD :
Why is that?
We now see Rose’s family standing in the living room behindher. They watch
her operate.
ROSE :
Come on. I mean, it’s kind of
obvious.
ROD :
What?

Page 81/94

ROSE :
That there’s something between us.
ROD :
No. I’m calling about Chris.
ROSE :
We’d all go out drinking... Iremember you looking at me.
Rod is put on the spot. He becomes extremely uncomfortable.
ROD :
That’s my best friend. If you didsomethingROSE :
I know you think about fucking me,
Rod.
ROD :
--No. You crazy... No.
86.
Rod hangs up in a panic. He looks at Sid helplessly.
Rose’s flirtacious smile goes blank. She places the phone onthe dining room
table and looks back at her family. They watchin approval.
INT. GAMES ROOM
“You’ve Got A Friend” plays.
Chris, still strapped to the chair, hangs his head inresignation. Eyes
shut, he sings along.
CHRIS :
...Winter, Spring, Summer andFall, all you need to do is call.
And I’ll be there. You got afriend. Ain’t it good to knowyou’ve got a
friend. Ain’t it goodto know you’ve got a friend. Oh,
yeah, yeah, you’ve got a friend.
The song is over. After a moment. Chris begins to sing theopening guitar
lick. He gets a couple notes before realizinghe’s singing alone.
The television in front of Chris flickers off and then back on
to the image of a tea cup comes into focus on the screen. Aspoon comes into
the shot and clinks the side of the cup.
“TING TING, TING TING”
CHRIS (CONT’D)
NoBefore he can react, Chris falls asleep.
Later...
Chris wakes up bald. Static snow clicks fills the TV lightingthe room. The

Page 82/94

image clicks to that of...
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY (TELEVISION)
Jim Hudson, also shaven, sits on a hospital bed. And facesChris through the
television.
JIM :
Hello Chris. How’s it going...?
You can answer. There’s an
intercom in the room; I can hear
you.
87.
CHRIS :
I need water.
JIM :
Yeah, sorry about that. If itmakes you feel any better, I’mthirsty too.
CHRIS :
I need to get outta here.
JIM :
Right. So, the reason I am talkingto you now is so you canunderstand what
is happening toyou. I guess your ‘understanding’it raises the success rate
of this
whole thing. Not even sure I‘understand’ it.
CHRIS :
Where’s Rose?
JIM :
Hot isn’t she? Hot voice anyway,
you dirty dog. You’re one of thelucky one’s. The son Jeremy’swrangling
method sounds way lesspleasant.
CHRIS :
Is this some kind of a game toyou?
JIM :
They asked me for my favoritesong, which was hard; I like alltypes of
music. Turns out theyreally just needed one I knew allthe words to: I went
with James
Taylor’s “You Got a Friend.” Ihope it hasn’t been too torturous;
that wasn’t the point. The pointis that you learn it, and for usto have

Page 83/94

that knowledge in common.
CHRIS :
Who the fuck are you people?
JIM :
Oh right. Okay, let me back up andgive you the cliff notes. TheArmitages
and I are a part of asociety. A pretty extraordinarysociety actually.
(MORE)
88.
JIM (CONT’D)
One whose sole purpose for manymany years has been a search for avery
powerful object. Armitagelineage redefined the nature ofthat search. They
proved that thepower didn’t just exist in thatobject; You see, with science
theArmitage’s created a miracle.
CHRIS :
You hypnotize me? Break my will..?
Make me a slave like the others?
This is some crazy racist shit.
JIM :
No. Not racist, Chris. We don’t
hate you. We want to be you... Youare not going to be a slave.
You’re going to be a vessel.
CHRIS :
Wait, what?
JIM :
Missy’s hypnosis was merely tosedate you. Oh, that and toprepare you
psychologically...
CHRIS :
For what?
Jim smiles.
JIM :
For the procedure.
CHRIS :
What’s the procedure?
JIM :

Page 84/94

Are you ready...? Drum rollplease. Brain transplantation.
Some say it could never be done;
JIM (CONT'D)
They experimented for centuries,
but it turned out re-linking thebrain to a foreign central nervoussystem
was impossible. The nerveconnections are far too intricate
and delicate.
89.
CHRIS :
What the fuck?
JIM:
Dean’s the only guy who really
gets the science. He’s the one who
discovered that full brain
transplantation isn’t actually
necessary to transfer the soul,
and that partial brain
transplantation solves the little
nerve ending problem.
CHRIS :
No.
Jim holds up a Color coded diagram of the human Brain. Thereis a big red
part that takes up 80% of the image. The other20% is blue and located near
the lower back of his skull.
JIM:
Okay so... You see the blue part?
That’s the piece of your brain
that’s all rooted in the nervous
system. So that stays; keeping
those tricky little connections
intact. The rest is discarded.
Then they’ll remove the red part
of my brain from my skull and put
in yours. Your “blue” and my “red”
basically absorb each other. And
apparently the brain heals
surprisingly fast, so assuming
everything goes as planned, we
should be up and functioning in a
couple weeks.

Page 85/94

CHRIS :
And my brain?
JIM:
Your red part? It’ll be discarded,
but don’t worry. You wont be gone.
Well not completely. You’ll still
be in there somewhere; limited
consciousness of course;
JIM (CONT'D)
you’ll still be able to see and
hear but your existence will be as
a passenger... an audience. You
will live in...
90.
CHRIS :
(defeated)
...The Sunken Place.
JIM:
Yes. That’s what she calls it.
Good! So you understand, I’ll
control the motor functions, the
will of our body, effectively
making meCHRIS :
Me... You will be me.
JIM:
As far as the world is concerned.
It’s still a pretty new operation.
Some kinks. We’re supposed to stay
away from flashes of light for
example. They can trigger a
“momentary lapse in control of
motor functions...”
CHRIS :
Why black people?
Jim is disappointed in the question.

Page 86/94

JIM:
Well, because you get the highest
bids. For the last decade or so
anyway. I wish it was less simple
than that, but it’s not. You’re in
fashion, baby!
Final hope sinks from. Chris shoulders.
JIM (CONT’D)
Honestly though, personally..? I
couldn’t give two shits about
race. I don’t care if you’re
black, brown, green, purple...
whatever. What I want is so much
deeper:
those things you see through.
CHRIS :
That’s crazy.
JIM :
Take it as a compliment.
CHRIS:
You’re not going to get away with
this.
91.
JIM :
We have and we will. We’ll be
together soon, brother.
The television turns off. Chris clenches his body trying topry free from
his restraints, before his shoulders collapsewith exhaustion. He lifts his
head to a rip in the leather armof the chair revealing its cotton stuffing.
He looks at thecotton. We see Chris make a difficult decision.
LATER...
We hear nothing except a HEART BEAT.
Chris’ head hangs, asleep. His lips are dry. Chris wakes up.
The Television turns on. On the screen, a woman’s hand holds a
tea cup. With a spoon, she clinks it. We don’t hear it though.
We still hear nothing but the HEART BEAT.
CHRIS :
No, No-

Page 87/94

Before Chris can finish SCREAMING, his eyes widen. He goeslimp -unconscious again.
Rose enters wearing a white and black nurse’s outfit with ared cross on the
chest. She rolls a medical table into the
room. She draws a dotted line across his forehead and around
to the back of his scalp. Then she unstraps his arm andprepares it for an
IV. She inserts the needle.
She goes to put earbuds connected to an ipod in his ears butsees the arm of
his chair has been stripped open. She looks atChris. Cotton makeshift
earplugs have been stuffed in hisears!
He’s not really hypnotized!
Rose tries to scream but Chris grabs her throat with his freehand and
squeezes. The HEARTBEAT quickens. Rose pleads, but wedon’t hear her.
ROSE :
(inaudible)
Wait. Wait. Chris!.... ChriChris chokes her. Tears stream down his face.
CHRIS :
Shhhh.
Rose convulses. She scratches his hand and cheeks. He’s too
strong. She stares at Chris’ eyes as her consciousness fades.
Then, through the agony, her face curls into a twisted smile.
She’s having fun. Psycho. Rose goes limp in Chris’ hands.
92.
Chris takes the cotton out of his ears. We can hear again.
“You’ve got a Friend” plays on the earbuds of the ipod.
INT. OPERATING ROOM.
Earbuds also rest in Jim Hudson’s ears playing the same song.
He lies unconscious on one of two operating beds in the centerof the room
connected to an IV and heart monitors.
A bright medical light shines on Jim’s shaved head which alsohas a dotted
line around it. The other bed is empty and has alight shining on it as
well. This bed is for Chris.
Dean stands in a black and white robe with a red cross in the
middle, his palms upwards in silent prayer near someceremonial candles.
Jeremy watches his father. They areunaware of what’s happening in the
Medical room down the hall.
Dean finishes his prayer.
DEAN :
Saw...
Jeremy hands Dean a circular surgical saw.

DEAN (CONT’D)
The vessel.
Jeremy leaves as Dean begins to saw into Jim’s cranium.
INT. DARK HALLWAY
Chris finds an old badminton set.
Jeremy exits the room briskly and walks down a dark hallway.
He turns into the games room and finds Rose’s body.
Jeremy’s eyes go wild. He turns as Chris emerges lunging fromthe darkness
with a badminton racket. Before Jeremy canscream, Chris slams him in the
face with the metal side of the
racket. He pulls Jeremy inside and shuts the door cutting offthe sound from
outside. Jeremy wilts in pain.
Chris whips him over and over warping the racket to a crumpledbloody mess.
INT. OPERATING ROOM
Dean finishes sawing the top of Jim’s skull off. He removesthe cranium
preciously exposing Jim’s brain.
93.
DEAN :
Jeremy...?
Dean walks to the doorway. Dean scans the dark hallway. It’squiet.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Ro Ro...?
Chris emerges charging from the darkness with Deer’s head inhis arms. He
punctures Dean through his neck and shoulder withthe antlers. Dean and
stumbles back into the operating room,
deer’s head attached.
DEAN (CONT’D)
MissHis call to Missy devolves into gargles. Dean falls knockingthe unused bed
over along with some candles. The bed hascaught fire. The fire grows fast.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
Missy takes a whistling tea pot off the stove and poursherself a cup.
Georgina sits nearby knitting. The window, likebefore reflects the room
around them.
She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off thelight
illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forthin the distance. She
turns the light back on again. Chris’reflection is now behind hers. He
looks savage; covered inblood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door.
Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining roomtable. He
goes for it.
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Chris runs through the dining room and finds his cell phone onthe dining
room table.

Page 89/94

Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. Theloading screen
comes up.
Chris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him.
It’s Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding herteacup and
spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup...
TING...
Chris knocks the cup out of her hand spraying hot water on herchest and
face. She screams.
94.
The cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris’ face. Chrispunches it
out of the air. This has given Missy enough time tograb a knife. She lunges
at Chris screaming psychotically.
Chris can’t pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabsthe tea pot and
cracks her in the head with it. She falls. Hehits her one more time. Done.
The cat slinks out an open window.
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
Chris runs towards the front door. Before he can open it, hehears a
footsteps running upstairs from the basement followedbloodcurdling scream
from back in the kitchen:
JEREMY (O.C.)
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
Jeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris’back. The two
roll around.
Chris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and usesit to put Chris
in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams theback of his head into Jeremy’s
face. He does it again, andagain, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter.
Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy’s pocket andpulls out his
keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy’s eye.
Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasptripping him with
an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges atChris again but slips on his own
blood banging the back of hishead on the coffee table. He’s out.
EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT
Chris begins to run but then sees the beige sports car werecognize from the
opening scene. He looks at Jeremy downed inthe doorway and then at the keys
in his hand.
Moments later...
INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT
Chris is in the driver’s seat. The tubular metal helmet sits
next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turnson. There is a
very small amount of batteries. He turns theignition. The English to French
